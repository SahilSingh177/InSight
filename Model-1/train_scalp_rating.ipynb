Only material derived from Acacia senegal are in current\\nuse according to industry data. The concentration at which these\\ningredients are reported to be used ranges from 9% in mascara to\\n0.0001% in tonics, dressings, and other hair-grooming aids. Gum\\narabic is a technical name for Acacia Senegal Gum. Gum ara-\\nbic is comprised of various sugars and glucuronic acid residues ina long chain of galactosyl units with branched oligosaccharides.\\nGum arabic is generally recognized as safe as a direct food ad-\\nditive. Little information is available to characterize the extracts\\nof other Acacia plant parts or material from other species. Aca-\\ncia Concinna Fruit Extract was generally described as contain-\\ning saponins, alkaloids, and malic acid with parabens and potas-\\nsium sorbate added as preservatives. Cosmetic ingredient functions\\nhave been reported for Acacia Decurrens Extract (astringent; skin-\\nconditioning agent—occlusive) and Acacia Farnesiana Extract (as-tringent), but not for the other Acacias included in this review. Tox-\\nicity data on gum arabic indicates little or no acute, short-term,or subchronic toxicity. Gum arabic is negative in several geno-toxicity assays, is not a reproductive or developmental toxin, and\\nis not carcinogenic when given intraperitoneally or orally. Clini-\\ncal testing indicated some evidence of skin sensitization with gum\\narabic. The extensive safety test data on gum arabic supports the\\nsafety of Acacia Senegal Gum and Acacia Senegal Gum Extract,and it was concluded that these two ingredients are safe as used\\nin cosmetic formulations. It was not possible, however, to relate\\nthe data on gum arabic to the crude Acacias and their extracts\\nfrom species other than Acacia senegal .

In 1998, a ﬁnal safety assessment was issued with theconclusion that the available data were not sufﬁcient to supportthe safety of these ingredients in cosmetics. The needed dataincluded concentration of use; speciﬁc chemical constituents,including the relationship between crude Acacias and their ex-tracts and the Acacias and their extracts that are used as cosmeticingredients; contaminants, particularly relating to the presenceof pesticide residues and a determination if Acacia melanoxy-lon is used in cosmetics, and whether acamelin (a quinone) andmelacacidin (a ﬂavin) are present in the Acacias that are beingused; skin sensitization dose response; contact urticaria data useconcentration; and ultraviolet (UV) absorption; if there is signif-icant absorbance in the UV A or UVB range, then a photosensiti-zation study may be needed. The Panel noted that other studiesmay be requested after clariﬁcation of the chemical constituentsof the Acacias.\\nIn 2000 and 2001, new data were received including use con-\\ncentration data on Acacia Senegal and Acacia Senegal Extract;\\n7576 COSMETIC INGREDIENT REVIEW\\ninformation on the composition of gum arabic and various Aca-\\ncia species; UV spectral analyses on Acacia Senegal Gum andAcacia Concinna Fruit Extract; impurities analysis for pesticideresidues in gum arabic; human skin tolerance test (skin irrita-tion evaluated) on 2% Acacia Concinna Fruit Extract; and hu-man maximization test data on a mascara containing 8% AcaciaSenegal. Based on this new information, the Panel has preparedthis amended safety assessment.\\nThe terminology with which the cosmetics industry describes\\nthese ingredients has changed over the past several years. Table 1shows the progression of terminology from the mid-1990s to2004. In some cases (e.g., Acacia Concinna Fruit Extract, AcaciaDealbata Leaf Wax, and Acacia Farnesiana Gum) the current\\nname for the ingredient (Gottschalck and McEwen 2004) better\\nreﬂects the source of the plant material. The current terminologywill be used in this report.\\nA key factor in the determination that the current data are\\nsufﬁcient was the ﬁnding that gum arabic is the equivalent ofAcacia Senegal Gum. Accordingly, the following is backgroundinformation on gum arabic and its relationship to gum producedby the Acacia senegal plant.\\nSudan is the world’s largest producer of gum arabic, and it is\\nthe main source of gum in international trade. Nigeria is the sec-ond largest producer of gum arabic. In the Sudan, the term gumarabic is inclusive of two types of gum that are produced andmarketed, “hashab” (from Acacia senegal ) and “talha” (from\\nAcacia seyal ). Gum arabic (hashab) from the Sudan is con-\\nsidered to be of the highest quality, and sets the standard bywhich other “gum arabics” are judged. Acacia senegal intrin-\\nsically produces a high-quality exudate (pale to orange-brown-\\ncolored solid) with superior technical performance; and, in theSudan, the collection, cleaning, sorting, and handling of it upto the time of export is well organized and highly efﬁcient. In awider sense, the name gum arabic often is understood to mean\\nthe gum from any Acacia species and is sometimes referred\\nto as “Acacia gum.” For example, gum arabic from Zimbabweis derived from Acacia karroo (Food and Agriculture Organi-\\nzation of the United Nations 1999). Acacia Senegal Gum hasbeen described as the major commercial Acacia gum (Anderson\\n1988).\\nAlthough most internationally traded gum arabic comes from\\nAcacia senegal , the term “gum arabic” may not imply a partic-\\nular botanical source. In a few cases, so-called gum arabic maynot even have been collected from Acacia species, but may orig-inate from Combretum ,Albizia , or some other genus (Food and\\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations 1999).\\nIn the International Cosmetic Ingredient Dictionary and\\nHandbook , gum arabic is listed as a technical name for Aca-\\ncia Catechu Gum, Acacia Farnesiana Gum, and Acacia Sene-gal Gum (Gottschalck and McEwen 2004). However, since thispublication, the Cosmetic, Toiletry, and Fragrance Association(CTFA) determined that gum arabic does not apply to AcaciaCatechu Gum or Acacia Farnesiana Gum and will no longerbe listed in the International Cosmetic Ingredient Dictionaryand Handbook as a technical/other name for these ingredients\\n(CTFA 2000b).\\nAccording to CTFA, gum arabic applies to the dried gummy\\nexudate from branches and stems of Acacia senegal and other\\nAcacia species from Africa, and Acacia catechu and Acacia\\nfarnesiana are not African species (CTFA 2000b).\\nThis deﬁnition is similar to the following deﬁnition of Acacia\\nthat is found in the National F ormulary (United States Pharma-\\ncopeial Convention 2000): Acacia is the dried gummy exudatefrom the stems and branches of Acacia senegal (Linn´ e) Wilde-\\nnow or of other related African species of Acacia (Family Legu-minosae). It has also been described as a complex mixture ofcalcium, magnesium, and potassium salts of arabic acid. Ara-bic acid is a complex of galactose, rhamnose, arabinose, andglucuronic acid (Frutarom Meer Corporation, no date).\\nGum arabic is a substance that is generally recognized as safe\\n(GRAS) for direct addition to human food under the provisionsof Section 184.1330 of the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR184.1330). A report, prepared for the Food and Drug Adminis-\\ntration (FDA), summarizing all available scientiﬁc data (1920\\nto 1972) related to the safety of gum arabic as a food ingredienthas been published (Informatics Inc. 1972). Studies from thatreport are referenced in the text of this report.\\nIn a subsequent report (prepared for FDA) evaluating the\\nsafety of gum arabic as a food ingredient, the Select Commit-tee on GRAS Substances of the Life Sciences Research Of-ﬁce, Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology(FASEB), concluded that “there is no evidence in the available\\ninformation on gum arabic that demonstrates a hazard to thepublic when it is used at levels that are now current and in the\\nmanner now practiced. However, it is not possible to determine,without additional data, whether a signiﬁcant increase in con-sumption would constitute a dietary hazard” (FASEB 1973).\\nThe Select Committee also determined that additional exper-\\niments should be undertaken to evaluate the signiﬁcance of gumArabic allergenicity to the population as a whole, and that itmay be advisable to conduct feeding studies in several animal\\nspecies (including pregnant animals) at dosage levels that ap-proximate and exceed the current maximum daily human intake\\n(see “Noncosmetic Use”).\\nStudies from the 1973 FASEB report are summarized in the\\ntext of this report. Studies on Acacia Senegal Gum and otherspecies of Acacia (listed in the International Cosmetic Ingredi-\\nent Dictionary and Handbook and those not listed) that have been\\npublished since the FASEB report was issued are also included.To ensure that the information in the present report is represen-tative of the published chemistry and toxicity data on species ofAcacia, the data presented involve various parts/components ofthe Acacia tree as well as the gummy exudate.\\nCHEMISTRY\\nDeﬁnitions of various ingredients derived from Acacia\\nspecies in the International Cosmetic Ingredient Dictionary andACACIA 77\\nTABLE 1\\nAcacia-derived cosmetic ingredient terminology, description, and function\\n1995–1997 Terminology 2004 Terminology\\n(Wenninger and McEwen 1995, 1997) (Gottschalck and McEwen 2004)\\nName Description Cosmetics function Name Description Cosmetics function\\nAcacia Catechu Plant material\\nderived fromAcacia catechuBiological additive Acacia Catechu EU term for Acacia\\nCatechu GumN/A\\nAcacia Catechu Dried, crushed core\\nofAcacia catechuBiological additive Acacia Catechu\\nGumDried, crushed core\\nofAcacia catechuNot reported\\nAcacia Concinna Plant material\\nderived fromAcacia concinnaNot reported Acacia Concinna EU term for Acacia\\nConcinna FruitExtractN/A\\nAcacia Concinna\\nExtractExtract of the fruit of\\nAcacia concinnaBiological additive Acacia Concinna\\nFruit ExtractExtract of the fruit of\\nAcacia concinnaNot reported\\nAcacia Dealbata Plant material\\nderived fromAcacia dealbataNot reported Acacia Dealbata EU term for Acacia\\nDealbata LeafExtractN/A\\nAcacia Dealbata\\nExtractExtract of the leaves\\nofAcacia\\ndealbataBiological additive Acacia Dealbata\\nLeaf ExtractExtract of the leaves\\nof the wattle,Acacia dealbataNot reported\\nAcacia Dealbata\\nLeaf WaxWax obtained from\\nthe leaves of\\nAcacia dealbataSkin-conditioning\\nagent—emollient;skin protectant\\nAcacia Decurrens Plant material\\nderived fromAcacia decurrensNot reported Acacia\\nDecurrensEU term for Acacia\\nDecurrens ExtractN/A\\nAcacia Decurrens\\nExtractExtract of the acacia,\\nAcacia decurrensBiological additive Acacia\\nDecurrensExtractExtract of the acacia,\\nAcacia decurrensAstringent;\\nSkin-conditioningagent—Occlusive\\nAcacia Farnesiana Plant material\\nderived fromAcacia farnesianaNot reported Acacia\\nFarnesianaEU term for Acacia\\nFarnesianaExtract, FlowerWax, and GumN/A\\nAcacia Farnesiana Plant material\\nderived from thedried, gummyexudate of theacacia, Acacia\\nfarnesianaNot reported Acacia\\nFarnesianaGumPlant material\\nderived from thedried, gummyexudate of theacacia, Acacia\\nfarnesianaNot reported\\nAcacia Farnesiana\\nExtractExtract of the\\nﬂowers and stems\\nof the the acacia,\\nAcacia farnesianaBiological additive Acacia\\nFarnesiana\\nExtractExtract of the\\nﬂowers and stems\\nof the the acacia,\\nAcacia farnesianaAstringent\\nAcacia\\nFarnesiana\\nFlower Waxwax obtained from\\nthe ﬂowers ofAcacia farnesianaSkin protectant\\nAcacia Senegal Plant material\\nderived fromAcacia senegalNot reported Acacia Senegal EU term for Acacia\\nSenegal Extract,Gum, and GumExtractN/A\\n(Continued on next page)78 COSMETIC INGREDIENT REVIEW\\nTABLE 1\\nAcacia-derived cosmetic ingredient terminology, description, and function (Continued)\\n1995–1997 Terminology 2004 Terminology\\n(Wenninger and McEwen 1995, 1997) (Gottschalck and McEwen 2004)\\nName Description Cosmetics function Name Description Cosmetics function\\nAcacia senegal Plant material\\nderived from thedried, gummyexudate of theacacia, Acacia\\nsenegalNot reported Acacia Senegal\\nGumPlant material\\nderived from thedried, gummyexudate of theacacia, Acacia\\nsenegalNot reported\\nAcacia Senegal\\nExtractExtract of the\\nﬂowers and stemsof the the acacia,Acacia senegalBiological additive Acacia Senegal\\nExtractExtract of the\\nﬂowers and stemsof the acacia,Acacia senegalNot reported\\nAcacia Senegal\\nGum ExtractExtract of the gum\\nof the acacia,Acacia senegalBiological additive Acacia Senegal\\nGum ExtractExtract of the gum\\nof the acacia,Acacia senegalNot reported\\nHandbook are included in Table 1 (Gottschalck and McEwen\\n2004). CAS numbers are listed for the following two: AcaciaCatechu Gum (CAS no. 8001-76-1) and Acacia Senegal Gum(CAS no. 9000-01-5).\\nChemical and Physical Properties\\nGum Arabic\\nThe gummy exudate from the Acacia senegal is a proteina-\\nceous polysaccharide, with protein content ranging from approx-\\nimately 1.5% to 3% for samples from various producing areas(World Health Organization 1990).\\nGum arabic is a white powder that is readily soluble in water,\\nbut insoluble in alcohol (Anonymous 1993). Molecular weightsof∼850,000 (Ross et al. 1984a, 1984b) and ∼240,000 (Frutarom\\nMeer Corporation no date), and a density of 1.35 to 1.49 (Dan-gerous Properties of Industrial Materials Report 1981) have beenreported. An aqueous solution is acid to litmus (Lewis 1993a).\\nPazur et al. (1986) indicated that gum arabic is composed\\nof\\nD-galactose, L-rhamnose, L-arabinose, and D-glucuronic acid\\nresidues in an arrangement of a main chain of galactosyl unitsjoined by β-\\nD-(1→3) linkages and side chains or branched\\noligosaccharides linked to the main chain by β-D-(1→6) link-\\nages. The oligosaccharides may contain terminal rhamnosylunits linked (1 →3) or terminal arabinofuranosyl units linked\\n(1→4) to internal galactosyl or glucuronosyl units. Based on\\nmethylation and degradation studies of gum arabic ( Acacia sene-\\ngal) along with periodate oxidation and other conﬁrmatory re-\\nactions, the structure for gum arabic shown in Figure 1 wasproposed (Informatics Inc. 1972).\\nGum arabic is almost completely soluble in twice its weight\\nof cold water, and the viscosity of the gum increases slowly atconcentrations up to 25%. At concentrations greater than 25%,the viscosity increases much more rapidly in proportion to the\\ngum content (Frutarom Meer Corporation no date).\\nUV Absorption\\nAn increase in absorbance for Acacia Senegal was observed\\nbetween 400 nm and approximately 260 nm, reaching a plateauat wavelengths ranging from 270 to ∼250 nm. A rapid increase\\nin absorbance was observed at wavelengths less than 250 nm(Avon Products, Inc. 2000a). UV absorption spectra providedon two other lots of Acacia gum (Acacia Senegal) were bothsimilar to the preceding UV spectral analysis (Avon Products,Inc. 2000b).\\nMethods of Production\\nGum arabic is produced when the Acacia tree is stressed by in-\\nfection, poor nutrition, heat, or lack of moisture. The gum exudesthrough wounds in the bark that occur naturally or are purposelymade to stimulate production. The exudate dries rapidly, is col-lected as hardened drops or tears, sorted, graded, and marketed.The gum becomes harder during storage; market preferencesexist for both the harder (old) and softer (new) gum (FASEB1973).\\nAccording to another source, the removal of the bark that ad-\\nheres to the tears is critical to the production of quality gum ara-bic. Additionally, in order to produce quality products, elaborateprocesses for the preclearing of milled gum and the centrifuga-tion and ﬁltration of feed solutions for spray dried gum must befollowed. The major growing regions for gum arabic are in theSudan and West Africa, and the Kordofan grade is consideredthe best (Frutarom Meer Corporation, no date).\\nGum arabic in solid form is imported from the Sudan. Ac-\\ncording to one source, the solid is converted to a liquid form andACACIA 79\\nFIGURE 1\\nProposed structure for Gum Arabic (Informatics 1972).\\nthe preservatives Proxel GXL (0.13%) and sodium benzoate are\\nthen added. Proxel GXL consists of 20% 1,2-benzisothiazolin-3-one (BIT) in aqueous dipropylene glycol (Freeman 1984).\\nCrude Acacia Concinna results from the drying and pulver-\\nization of the pods of Acacia concinna . The extract of these\\npods (Acacia Concinna Fruit Extract) is drawn by cold process-ing (Carlisle International Corporation 1997a).\\nComposition, Analytical Methods, and Impurities\\nThe following three grades of gum arabic have been noted\\nin the published literature: (1) processed gum arabic recoveredby spray-drying from a solution of commercial food grade gumarabic after ﬁltration to remove sand, etc., and after heat treat-ment to effect pasteurization; (2) ﬁnely powdered natural gumarabic of poor commercial quality, giving solutions of a darkreddish brown color; (3) ﬁnely powdered natural gum arabic ofvery high quality, giving essentially colorless solutions (Strobelet al. 1982). Gum arabic has been analyzed by gas chromatog-raphy (Lawrence and Iyengar 1985) and has been identiﬁed bymicroelectrophoresis (Informatics Inc. 1972).\\nPowdered gum arabic contains moisture (15% maximum)\\nand insoluble ash (0.5% maximum). The pH of a 10% solutionis approximately 4.6 (Frutarom Meer Corporation, no date). Thefollowing speciﬁcations exist for United States Pharmacopoeia\\n(USP) grade Acacia: loss on drying (15% maximum), total ash\\n(4% maximum), arsenic (3 ppm), lead (0.001%), and heavymetals (0.004%) (United States Pharmacopeial Convention, Inc.2000).\\nFDA has listed Acacia (Gum Arabic) as a direct food addi-\\ntive that meets the speciﬁcations of the F ood Chemicals Codex(21 CFR 184.1330). The speciﬁcations for food grade Aca-\\ncia include arsenic (3 mg/kg maximum); ash, acid-insoluble(0.5% maximum); ash, total (4% maximum); heavy metals(0.002% maximum); insoluble matter (1% maximum); lead(5 mg/kg maximum); and loss on drying (15% maximum) (FoodChemicals Codex 1996).\\nAnderson et al. (1990) compared the amino acid composition\\nof Sudanese and Nigerian gum arabic. Analyses were done onsamples collected over a 13-year period for samples from theSudan and over 9 years for those from Nigeria. The data arepresented in Table 2.\\nAnderson et al. (1991) analyzed gum arabic samples pro-\\nvided by importers shown in Table 3. All samples conformedto the revised Joint Food and Agriculture Organization of theUnited Nations/World Health Organization, Expert Committeeon Food Additives (JECFA) speciﬁcation in respect of solubil-ity, complete in cold water; acid-insoluble ash, ( >0.5%) and\\nmatter ( >1%); starch/dextrin (absent); tannin (absent); arsenic\\n(>3 ppm), lead ( >10 ppm), heavy metals ( >40 ppm) (JECFA\\n1990). All samples were conﬁrmed by nuclear magnetic reso-nance (NMR) spectroscopy to be “good” Acacia senegal .\\nAnderson et al. (1990) also analyzed the ash from gum arabic\\nsamples from these same two countries. These data are given inTable 4.\\nWest Coast Analytical Service, Inc.

A sample “passes” if it meets thesespeciﬁcations (Carlisle International Corporation 1997a).\\nInformation on the composition and impurities of various\\nspecies of Acacia and their contaminants is included in Table 6.The Acacia species that are listed in the International Cos-\\nmetic Ingredient Dictionary and Handbook are identiﬁed with\\nan asterisk.\\nAs noted in Table 6, aﬂatoxin has been detected in the bark\\nand seeds of Acacia catechu (Roy and Kumari 1988, 1991).\\nAbdalla (1988) also described gum-yielding Acacia twigs fromthe Sudan (supplier of Acacia Senegal Gum) as a source ofaﬂatoxin (81 to >1000μg/kg).\\nSmith et al. (1990), however, found no detectable aﬂatoxin in\\neither of two samples of gum arabic analyzed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The assay system was capable ofdetermining aﬂatoxin in the concentration range of 2.0 to 200.0ppb in gum arabic.\\nData from the European Federation for Cosmetic Ingredients\\n(EF fCI) describes the components of the plant material from\\nvarious Acacia species. While there are some similarities, thereare many differences in composition (EF fCI 2000). These data\\nare given in Table 7.Reactivity\\nWhen Gum Acacia is weakly hydrolyzed by hydrochloric\\nacid at room temperature, pentose is split off (Marrack andCarpenter 1938). Partial acid hydrolysis has also yielded galac-tose and complex sugar acids (Heidelberger et al. 1929).\\nGum Acacia emits acrid smoke when heated to decompo-\\nsition (Lewis 1993b). Heating a solution of Acacia for a fewminutes at 100\\n◦C destroys peroxidase (oxidizing agent) present\\nin the gum and the colored derivatives produced (Gennaro 1990).\\nUSE\\nPurpose in Cosmetics\\nThe functions of these ingredients in cosmetics as described\\nin the International Cosmetic Ingredient Dictionary and Hand-\\nbook are given in Table 1 (Wenninger et al. 2000).\\nReportedly, Acacia concinna pods are a useful hair wash, in\\nthat they promote hair growth, kill lice, and remove dandruff.The active constituents of Acacia concinna pods (saponins, alka-\\nloids, tannins, and malic acid) are said to have cleansing, stimu-lating, and astringent properties. The astringent action providestoning of the scalp and conditioning of the hair. Additionally,the active constituents are said to offer effective skin and scalpexfoliation (Carlisle International Corporation 1997b).\\nScope and Extent of Use in Cosmetics\\nThe product formulation data submitted to the FDA in 2001\\nindicated that Acacia was used in 33 cosmetic products andthat Acacia Senegal was used in 1 cosmetic product (Table 8)(FDA 2001). Neither the species nor the plant part was furtherdelineated in the category “Acacia.” It is assumed that AcaciaSenegal is Acacia Senegal Gum.\\nCurrent concentration of use data are given in Table 8. These\\ndata from industry (CTFA 2000a) show the highest concentra-tion of Acacia Senegal Gum (9%) in shampoos. Acacia SenegalGum Extract was reported at a concentration of 0.001% in bathsoaps and detergents. For many uses of these ingredients, in-formation regarding use concentration for speciﬁc product cate-gories is provided, but the number of such products is not known,but they must be assumed to be in use.\\nRecommended use concentrations of Acacia Concinna Fruit\\nExtract are 0.5% to 5.0% (Carlisle International Corporation1997a) and 1.0% to 2.0% for use in shampoos, hair packs, hairconditioners, and hair rinses (Carlisle International Corporation\\n1997b).\\nCosmetic products containing Acacia are applied to most\\nparts of the body and could come in contact with the ocular andnasal mucosae. These products could be used on a daily basis,and could be applied frequently over a period of several years.\\nAcacias are not included among the substances listed as pro-\\nhibited from use in cosmetic products that are marketed in theEuropean Union (EEC 2001).

It is approved for use in various food categories at thefollowing maximum permitted usage levels: 2.0% (beverage andbeverage bases), 5.6% (chewing gum), 12.4% (confections andfrostings), 1.3% (dairy product analogs), 1.5% (fats and oils),2.5% (gelatins, puddings, and ﬁllings), 46.5% (hard candy andcough drops), 8.3% (nuts and nut products), 6.0% (quiescentlyfrozen confection products), 4.0% (snack foods), 85.0% (softcandy), and 1% (all other food categories).\\nUses of gum arabic in the various food categories in-\\nclude: emulsiﬁer and emulsiﬁer salt, ﬂavoring agent and ad-juvant, formulation aid, stabilizer and thickener, humectant,surface-ﬁnishing agent, processing aid, and texturizer (21 CFR184.1330). Gum arabic is also listed as one of the optional blend-ing ingredients of vanilla powder (21 CFR 169.179) and vanilla-\\nvanillin powder (21 CFR 169.182).\\nThe following maximum values for possible daily human\\nintake (g/kg body weight) of gum arabic in the total diet havebeen calculated for various age groups by the Select Committeeon GRAS Substances using data from the National ResearchCouncil: 115 mg/kg (0 to 5 months), 322 mg/kg (6 to 11 months),329 mg/kg (12 to 23 months), and 113 mg/kg (2 to 65 +years)\\n(FASEB 1973).\\nAt the 35th meeting of the JECFA, held in Rome from May\\n29 to June 7, 1989, JECFA conﬁrmed its acceptable daily intake\\n(ADI) of gum arabic as “not speciﬁed.” Here, gum arabic (a.k.a.gum Acacia) is deﬁned as the dried gummy exudate from tropicaland subtropical Acacia senegal trees.\\nADI “not speciﬁed” is applicable to a food substance of very\\nlow toxicity, which, on the basis of the available data (chemical,biochemical, toxicological, and other), the total dietary intakeof the substance arising from its use at the levels necessary toachieve the desired effect, and from its acceptable backgroundin food does not, in the opinion of the JECFA, represent a hazardto health. For that reason, and for reasons stated in individualevaluations, the establishment of an ADI expressed in numericalform is not deemed necessary. An additive meeting this criterionmust be used within the bounds of good manufacturing practice,i.e., it should be technologically efﬁcacious and should be usedat the lowest level necessary to achieve this effect; it should notconceal inferior food quality or adulteration, and it should not\\ncreate a nutritional imbalance (JECFA 1990).84 COSMETIC INGREDIENT REVIEW\\nTABLE 7\\nChemicals found in Acacia species (EF fCI 2000)\\nAcacia catechu plant Acacia decurrens plant Acacia farnesiana plant Acacia senegal plant\\n(+)-afzelichin ( +)-catechin ( +)-catechol 4-methoxyglucuronic\\nacid\\n3-(beta- L-arabopyranoside)- L-arabinose 3,3/prime,4/prime,5/prime,7-pentahydroxy-2-\\nphenylchroman(+)-gallocatechol Arabic acid\\n3-methoxyﬂavones 3,3/prime,4,4/prime,7/prime-pentahydroxyﬂavin Apigenin-6,8-bis-beta-\\nD-glucopyranosideArabinose\\n4-(4- O-methyl-alpha- D-\\nglucuronoside)- L-arabinose3-methyl- L-rhamnose Aromadendrin Ascorbic acid\\n4-hydroxypipecolic acid 7,3/prime,4/prime,5-tetrahydroxyﬂavan-3-\\nO-L-catechinAspartic acid Aspartic acid\\n5-(beta- D-xylopyranoside)- L-arabinose Acetic acid Cresols Beta sitosterol\\n7,3,4-trihydroxy-3,8-dimethoxyﬂavone Aldobionic acid Ellagic acid Beta\\nsitosterol- D-glucose\\n7,8,14/prime-trihydroxyﬂavonol Alpha cellulose Ethyl ester Cysteine\\n7,8,4-trihydroxy-3-methoxyﬂavone Anthocyanidin Hydroxyacetophenone D-galactose\\n8-methoxyﬁsetin Anthocyanilidine Isorhamnetin-3-\\nrutinosideD-glucoside\\n9-methoxyﬂavone-3,4-diones Beta carotene Kaempferol Dimethyltryptamine\\nAcacatechin Carbohydrates Kaempferol-7-\\ngalloylglucoseErythrodiol\\nAcetaldehyde Cellulose Kaempferol-7-\\nglucosideGalactoglucuronid acid\\nAldobiuronic acid D-galacturonic acid Linamarin Glucuronic acid\\nAlpha-amino-beta-\\noxalylaminopropionicacidD-pinetol Lotaustralin HCN\\nAlpha catechin Fiber m-digallic acid Hentriacontane\\nBeta catechin Fisetinidin Methyl gallate HentriacontanolBoron Fructose Mucilage KaempferolCatechuic acid Gallocatechin Myricetin-4\\n/prime-\\nmethylether-3-\\nrhamnosideL-arabinose\\nCatechutannic acid Indoleacetic acid N-acetyl-djenkkolic\\nacidL-rhamnose\\nCobalt L-arabinose Naringenin-7-\\nglucosideLeucine\\nD-galactose L-rhamnose Naringenin-7-\\nrhamnoglucosideMagnesium\\nD-glucuronic acid Lignin Pipecholic acid Octacosanol\\nD-xylose Mearnsitrin Prunin- O-6/prime-gallate Peroxidase\\nDiamino acid Methanol Quercetin-3- O-\\nrutinosidePotassium\\nDihydrokaempferol Methylsalicylic ester Salicylic acid Quercetin\\nDL-catechol Pelargonidin Tyramine Rhamnose\\nDL-epicatechin Phlobaphene Rhamnose hydrate\\nFisetin Phlobaphene anhydride SerineFlavotannin Phloroglucinol SitosterolFormaldehyde Proanthocyanidin Sodium\\n(Continued on next page)ACACIA 85\\nTABLE 7\\nChemicals found in Acacia species (EF fCI, 2000) (Continued)\\nAcacia catechu plant Acacia decurrens plant Acacia farnesiana plant Acacia senegal plant\\nGallic acid Protocatechuic acid Sucrose\\nGallotannin Robinetin TanninGamma-catechin Rutin Uronic acidGlucosyluronic acid Xanthophyll V alineGumIsocacatechinIsorhamnetinIsovaleraldehydeKaempferol\\nL-epicatechin\\nL-leucomacluricglycol ether\\nL-rhamnose\\nMagnesium\\nMalate dehydrogenaseManganesePeroxidasePhlobatanninPhosphataseProcyanidinQuercetagetin\\nQuercetinQuercitrinRutin\\nSiliconTanninTaxifolinUronic acid\\nGum arabic (Acacia Senegal Gum) is used in the pharmaceu-\\ntical industry to stabilize emulsions during the preparation oftablets (Collins et al. 1987). It is also used for its demulcent ac-tion in the treatment of throat or gastric inﬂammation (Gennaro1990).\\nThe therapeutic efﬁcacy of Acacia Catechu in the treatment\\nof lepromatous leprosy has been reported (Ojha et al. 1969).\\nGum Arabic has also been used in glues, lithographic so-\\nlutions, and matches (tip and binder in striking surface), andpolisher and textile ﬁnishes (van Ketel 1984).\\nThe following uses of Acacia Concinna in folk medicine\\nhave been reported: A chutney (pungent relish of fruits, spices,and herbs) made of the tender leaves of Acacia concinna , salt\\ntamarind, and chilies is administered for the treatment of bil-ious affections such as jaundice. An infusion of the leavesis used in the treatment of malarial fever; it checks ﬂatu-lence and serves as a mild laxative. Furthermore, repeated,large doses of a decoction of the Acacia concinna pods act\\nas an emetic and purgative (Carlisle International Corporation1997b).An ointment made from the Acacia concinna pods reportedly\\nis used in the treatment of skin diseases (Carlisle InternationalCorporation 1997b).\\nBIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES\\nAbsorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion\\nGum Arabic\\nThe weight gain for rats fed gum arabic at a dietary con-\\ncentration of 16% was 75% of that reported for control rats. Itwas determined that approximately 80% of the gum arabic wasabsorbed (Informatics 1972).\\nIn a study using rats, an apparent decrease in the caloric value\\nof gum arabic with increasing administered dose was noted.Gum arabic was incorporated into the diet at concentrations of5%, 10%, and 17%. Digestibility data indicated that up to 80%of the gum arabic was absorbed (Informatics Inc. 1972).\\nFollowing a 48 h fast, 20 young male rats were fed 10 mg of a\\nmixture consisting of 34% white, powdered gum arabic and 66%cacao butter. At 72 h after feeding, the rats were anesthetized86 COSMETIC INGREDIENT REVIEW\\nTABLE 8\\nProduct formulation data on Acacia and Acacia Senegal\\nProduct category Formulations with ingredient Concentration of use(total formulations in category) (FDA 2001) (FDA 2001) (CTFA 2000a) (%)\\nAcacia\\nOther bath preparations (193) 1 —Mascara (187) 18 —Other eye makeup preparations (151) 2 —Hair tints (49) 1 —Hair color sprays (Aerosol) (5) 1 —Other hair-coloring preparations (59) 3 —Foundations (319) 1 —Lipstick (942) 1 —Other makeup preparations (186) 1 —Body and hand skin care preparations (excluding shaving) (827) 3 —Paste masks (mud packs) (269) 1 —\\n2001 totals for Acacia 33 —\\nAcacia Senegal Gum\\nEyebrow pencil — 1Eyeliner — 3Mascara (187) 1 3–9Powders (dusting and talcum; excluding aftershave talc) — 0.5Tonics, dressings, and other hair grooming aids — 0.0001\\nOther skin care preparations — 0.02\\n2001 totals for Acacia Senegal Gum 1 —\\nAcacia Senegal Gum Extract\\nBath soaps and detergents — 0.001\\n2001 totals for Acacia Senegal Gum Extract — —\\nand the liver was removed and analyzed for glycogen content.The difference in glycogen concentration between control andfed rats was insigniﬁcant. Therefore, it was concluded that thegum arabic molecule was not metabolized by enzymes of the ratdigestive tract (Informatics Inc. 1972; FASEB 1973).\\nOther studies have indicated that gum arabic is partially di-\\ngested in the rat. In one study, weight gain and feed efﬁciencywere determined using groups of six rats fed 15% gum arabic for\\n62 days. Feed efﬁciency was identical between experimental andcontrol groups. However, compared to the control group (meanweight gain =199 g), rats fed gum arabic had a mean weight\\ngain of 224 g. In another study, groups of ﬁve rats were pair-fedgum arabic (0.75 g/day; added to 5 g basal diet). Results indi-cated that the digestibility of gum arabic was 71% (InformaticsInc. 1972).\\nRoss et al. (1984b) evaluated the metabolism of gum arabic\\nusing albino Wistar male rats (3 months old; weights =350 g).\\nThe number of animals used in the study was not stated. Twogroups of animals were fed Oxoid breeders diet only and Oxoidbreeders diet plus 200 g gum arabic/kg ad libitum, respectively,for 4 weeks. Oxoid breeders diet was described as a reconstituted\\ndiet that allowed the ready incorporation of gum arabic into pelletform.\\nFeces were collected during the 24 h period before animals\\nwere killed. Following ad libitum overnight feeding, the animalswere killed using a combination of diethyl ether anesthesia andcervical dislocation and contents from the stomach, small bowel,cecum, and distal colon were removed.\\nFor rats fed gum arabic in the diet, a white ﬂocculent pre-\\ncipitate typical of gum arabic was detected in contents fromthe stomach and small intestine, but not from the cecum, distalcolon, or in the feces. The fact that precipitable gum arabic wasdetected along the gastrointestinal (GI) tract as far as the termi-nal ileum, but not in the cecum, suggests that the metabolism ofgum arabic is mediated by bacteria in the cecum.\\nIn animals in which the cecum was resected, precipitable\\ngum arabic was detected along the length of the entire residual\\nintestine. This observation suggests that in the absence of thebacterial mass resident in the cecum, there is no degradation ofgum arabic. No precipitate typical of gum arabic was found inACACIA 87\\nthe GI tract of control rats that received the Oxoid breeders diet\\nonly (Ross et al. 1984b).\\nA total caloric intake slightly greater than that for starch has\\nbeen reported for gum arabic in rabbits. Evidence of glycoge-nesis was also demonstrated in this study. Thus, it appears thatrabbits are able to utilize gum arabic (FASEB 1973).\\nIn a study involving guinea pigs, it was determined that gum\\narabic was highly digestible (90%) when administered in thediet at a concentration of 15% for 10 days (Informatics 1972).\\nResults of studies in which dogs and rabbits were injected\\nintravenously with gum arabic indicated that gum arabic or someother product associated with it accumulated in the liver andremained in the tissues for several months. Nonlethal effectsincluded serious disturbances in hemoglobin, white blood cells,and serum proteins (FASEB 1973).\\nUsing many of the studies summarized above, the Select\\nCommittee on GRAS Substances determined in 1973 that gumarabic can be digested to simple sugars. However, it was also de-termined that conclusive evidence indicating that the intact gumarabic molecule is absorbed under normal conditions was lack-ing (FASEB 1973). It should also be noted that data on the fateof undigested gum arabic in male rats (Ross et al. 1984b) havebeen published since the FASEB report was issued. The resultsof this previously summarized study suggest that the bacterialmass resident in the cecum is responsible for the metabolism ofgum arabic.\\nHypotensive Activity\\nAcacia (Not Gum Arabic)\\nSham et al. (1984) evaluated the hypotensive activity of Aca-\\ncia catechu (aqueous extract of branches) using four groups\\nof four anesthetized dogs (males and females; weights =8t o\\n12 kg). The right femoral artery and vein were cannulated forblood pressure recordings and intravenous injection. After a30-min equilibration period, Acacia catechu was injected (bolus\\ninjection) into dogs from each of the four groups. Doses rangedfrom<1t o∼2 mg/kg. Changes in mean arterial blood pressure\\n(MAP) were recognized as differences between the steady MAPbefore injection and the lowest MAP after injection.\\nThe results were presented as a log dose-response curve.\\nAcacia catechu induced dose-related hypotensive responses. At\\nhigh doses, the hypotensive effect lasted approximately 30 min.Based on experimentation with various blocking agents, it wasdetermined that this effect was not mediated through α- andβ-\\nadrenergic, cholinergic, or histaminergic receptors, or related toautonomic ganglion transmission.\\nThe hypotensive activity of Acacia catechu (aqueous extract\\nof branches) was also evaluated using four groups of ﬁve male\\nSprague-Dawley rats (weights between 170 and 250 g) accord-\\ning to the procedure in the preceding paragraph; however, inthis experiment, the left carotid artery and jugular vein werecannulated.\\nAcacia catechu induced dose-related hypotensive responses\\nin rats over the range of doses tested (1 to 2 mg/kg). It was alsodetermined that the hypotensive responses were not mediatedthrough α- andβ-adrenergic, cholinergic, or histaminergic re-\\nceptors, or related to autonomic ganglion transmission (Shamet al. 1984).\\nThese same authors reported that, in an in vitro experiment,\\nAcacia catechu induced a dose-dependent relaxation of heli-\\ncal strips of rat tail artery that had been preconstricted with thevasoconstrictors arginine vasopressin and methoxamine, respec-\\ntively. In the presence of arginine vasopressin, Acacia catechu\\nwas tested at concentrations of 0.01, 0.03, and 0.1 mg/ml. Aca-\\ncia catechu was tested at concentrations of 0.1, 0.3, and 1 mg/ml\\nin the presence of methoxamine (Sham et al. 1984).\\nHypocholesterolemic Activity\\nAcacia (Not Gum Arabic)\\nChaudhari and Hatwalne (1973) determined the hypocholes-\\nterolemic activity of the dried water extract of Acacia catechu ,\\nalso known as katha in India. They used three groups of 10 malealbino rats (weights =100 to 125 g). One group was fed stock\\ndiet thoroughly mixed with 1% cholesterol, and a second groupwas fed stock diet thoroughly mixed with 1% cholesterol plus0.2% katha. The control group was fed stock diet only. The dietswere fed ad libitum. Half of the animals in each group werekilled after 6 weeks of feeding, and the remaining animals werekilled after 12 weeks of feeding. The cholesterol content of theserum and liver was determined for each rat.\\nA progressive increase in serum and liver cholesterol con-\\ntent was observed in animals fed the stock diet supplementedwith cholesterol for 6 months. In animals fed stock diet supple-mented with cholesterol and katha for 6 months, the elevation of\\nserum and liver cholesterol levels was signiﬁcantly lower ( p=\\n.001) when compared to rats fed stock diet supplemented with\\ncholesterol.\\nHowever, at the end of 12 weeks, the increase in serum and\\nliver cholesterol concentrations in rats fed stock diet supple-mented with cholesterol and katha was elevated by approxi-\\nmately 50% when compared to rats fed stock diet supplemented\\nwith cholesterol only. It was also determined that there was sub-stantially less deposition of lipids in the liver of katha-fed rats.It was concluded that katha had hypocholesterolemic activity inthis study, and that it helped prevent fatty degeneration of theliver (Chaudhari and Hatwalne 1973).\\nHypoglycemic Activity\\nAcacia (Not Gum Arabic)\\nWassel et al. (1992) studied the hypoglycemic activity of\\nethanolic extracts of the pod, leaf, stem, old stem, and ﬂowerofAcacia farnesiana L. Willd using groups of 11 alloxanized\\ndiabetic albino rats (weights =150 to 200 g). To prevent the\\ndevelopment of fatal hypoglycemia during the ﬁrst 12 h afteralloxan administration, a 25% glucose solution (5 to 10 ml)was subcutaneously injected at 2 t o 3 h intervals. Extract from\\neach plant part (dose =30 or 50 mg/kg in polysorbate 80) was\\nadministered orally to a group of 11 rats, and blood samples were\\ntaken at 2 h post administration. Blood samples were collected88 COSMETIC INGREDIENT REVIEW\\nprior to treatment in order to estimate the normal blood glucose\\nlevel of fasting rats.\\nThe hypoglycemic activity of ethanolic extracts of Aca-\\ncia farnesiana stem and pod was considerable following the\\nadministration of a 50 mg/kg dose. Acacia farnesiana stem and\\npod caused 21% and 36% reductions in the normal fasting bloodsugar level, respectively (Wassel et al. 1992).\\nEffects on Smooth Muscle\\nAcacia (Not Gum Arabic)\\nWassel et al. (1992) also studied the effect of ethanolic ex-\\ntracts of the pod, leaf, stem, old stem, and ﬂower of Acacia far-\\nnesiana L. Willd on uterine motility. Rat uteri at various stages\\nof the estrous cycle were suspended in 50-ml baths containingoxygenated Krebs solution; uteri were equilibrated in the solu-tion for at least 90 min. Drugs were added to the water bath andwere retained until the highest contraction was achieved.\\nNormal rhythmic contractions of the isolated uteri were ﬁrst\\nrecorded using a T\\n2isotonic transducer and two channel MD 2\\noscillograph. Subsequently, the plant extracts (in polysorbate 80)were added to organ water baths at a dose of 50 or 75 mg/50 mlbath. The drug used to induce uterine contraction was then re-\\nmoved by washing the preparation with fresh Krebs solution.\\nMost of the Acacia farnesiana ethanolic extracts stimulated\\nuterine muscular contraction during the estrous cycle and preg-nancy. However, some of the extracts had a stimulatory effecton uterine contraction, followed by inhibition (i.e., leaf extracton non-estrus uteri and pod extract on pregnant uterus). Thestem extract of Acacia farnesiana inhibited contraction of the\\npregnant uterus (Wassel et al. 1992).\\nTrivedi et al. (1986) evaluated the bronchodilator activity of\\nAcacia farnesiana using the perfused, isolated guinea pig lung.\\nThe control guinea pig lung preparation was treated with saline.The unripe pods of Acacia farnesiana were collected and dried\\nat room temperature. The glycosidal fraction of the ethyl alcoholextract of coarsely powdered Acacia pods was then isolated, andan aqueous solution of this fraction was tested.\\nDoses of 2, 5, and 10 μg of the aqueous solution increased\\noutﬂow in the isolated lung perfusion preparation, indicatingthat the glycosidal fraction induced a smooth muscle relaxant ef-\\nfect. The same doses also increased outﬂow following histamine\\n(10μg)-induced contraction, and the bronchodilator effect was\\nnot blocked by propranolol (400 μg). These results suggested\\nthat the glycosidal fraction exerted a direct relaxant action onthe bronchial muscles. The investigators noted that this effect isnot mediated through β-adrenergic receptors.\\nThe vasodilator activity of Acacia farnesiana was evaluated\\nin vitro. The glycosidal fraction of the ethyl alcohol extract ofcoarsely powdered Acacia pods was isolated, and an aqueoussolution of this fraction was tested. The hind limb of dogs wasperfused through the femoral artery with oxygenated, deﬁbri-nated blood in Ringer’s solution. Femoral venous outﬂow wasrecorded periodically. The control preparation was treated withnormal saline.The aqueous glycosidal fraction induced vasodilation at doses\\nof 2, 5, and 10 μg (% increases in blood ﬂow/min of 21.4, 20.86,\\nand 24.3, respectively; n=5). V asodilation was not blocked\\nfollowing the addition of any of the following agents: chlor-phenaramine maleate (20 μg), atropine (20 μg), or propranolol\\n(400μg). Study results indicated that the glycosidal fraction\\nofAcacia farnesiana had a smooth muscle relaxant effect. The\\ninvestigators noted that this effect was not mediated throughcholinergic or H\\n1receptors (Trivedi et al. 1986).\\nAnti-Inﬂammatory Activity\\nAcacia (Not Gum Arabic)\\nThe anti-inﬂammatory activity of Acacia farnesiana was\\nevaluated in vitro. The glycosidal fraction of the ethyl alcoholextract of coarsely powdered Acacia pods was isolated, and an\\naqueous solution of this fraction was tested. The effect of this\\nfraction on chemically induced edema of the rat hind paw wasevaluated according to the method of Winter et al. (1962). Theglycosidal fraction inhibited carrageenin and formaldehyde in-duced inﬂammation of the rat hind paw in vivo (% inhibitionof 38.2 and 26.26, respectively; p<. 001, n=10). It was\\nconcluded that this fraction has a promising anti-inﬂammatoryeffect (Trivedi et al. 1986).\\nOxidative Phosphorylation\\nGum Arabic\\nBachmann et al. (1978) administered gum arabic twice daily\\nto groups of four rats (weights =100 to 110 g) at concentra-\\ntions of 1%, 2%, and 10%, respectively, 5 days per week for4 weeks. The test substance was suspended in distilled waterand administered orally at a dose volume of 0.2 ml/100 g bodyweight; control rats were given equal volumes of distilled water.The actual doses of gum arabic administered were 2 ×20, 2×\\n40, and 2 ×200 mg/kg/day. Groups of four rats were killed by\\ncervical dislocation 16 h after administration of the last dose.Following maceration and homogenization, heart and liver mi-\\ntochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation. Electrontransfer reactions (oxygen consumption) and oxidative phospho-\\nrylation were measured polarographically. The hydroxylation ofbiphenyl was chosen as the assay system for measuring mixedfunction oxidases of hepatic cell endoplasmic reticulum.\\nDose-dependent uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation\\nwas the primary effect on cardiac and hepatic cell mitochon-drial function. The damage to cardiac mitochondria progressedas dosing continued. However, hepatic cell mitochondrial func-tion seemed to have gradually returned to normal during thefourth week of dosing.\\nAt the highest administered dose (2 ×200 mg/kg/day)\\nmarked uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation was observedin the heart and liver after 2 days of dosing. Partial recovery wasreported for cardiac mitochondria after the ﬁrst week of dosing;however, the same degree of uncoupling was noted up to the endof the experiment. Hepatic cell mitochondria were said to have\\nrecovered slowly as the experiment progressed. Gum arabic alsoACACIA 89\\ncaused a progressive inhibition of the biphenylhydroxylase sys-\\ntem in the hepatic microsomal fraction (Bachmann et al. 1978).\\nLutz et al. (1978) considered these results and investi-\\ngated whether comparable biochemical effects of gum arabic(USP grade) could also be demonstrated in vivo. The mea-surement of maximal aminopyrine demethylation as expiredCO\\n2was deemed a suitable approach for this investigation,\\nwhich was conducted using female rats of the ZUR SIV-Z strain(weights =152 to 180 g). Oral dosing with 10% ( w/v )\\ngum arabic had no effect on the in vivo demethylation of4-dimethyl[\\n14C]-aminoantipyrine (Lutz et al. 1978).\\nAntimicrobial Activity\\nAcacia (Not Gum Arabic)\\nThe antimicrobial activity of ethanolic extracts of plant or-\\ngans from Acacia farnesiana was evaluated. Extracts were made\\nfrom the following plant parts: the pod, leaf, stem, old stem, andﬂower. Bacteria and yeast were cultured and ﬁlter paper diskswere impregnated with 10 μl of each extract. Each disk (one\\nextract per disk) was then dried and placed on the surface of theinoculated agar medium, and cultures were incubated for 48 hand observed for zones of inhibition. All plant extracts were\\ninhibitory to Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus. Ad-\\nditionally, most of the extracts were inhibitory to Sarcina lutea ,\\nPseudomonas aeruginosa , and Escherichia coli . The plant ex-\\ntracts had no effect on Mycobacterium phlei orCandida albicans\\n(Wassel et al. 1992).\\nANIMAL TOXICOLOGY\\nAcute Oral Toxicity\\nGum Arabic\\nIn an acute oral toxicity study using rabbits (weights and\\nstrain not stated), an Acacia Gum LD\\n50of 80 g/kg was reported\\n(Dangerous Properties of Industrial Materials Report 1981).\\nAcacia (Not Gum Arabic)\\nLetizia et al. (2000) conducted a study in which the acute\\noral toxicity of Acacia Farnesiana Extract (from ﬂowers) wasevaluated using ten rats (strain not stated). The test substance wasadministered at a dose of 5.0 g/kg, and animals were observed for14 days. Necropsy was performed at the end of the observationperiod.\\nAn LD\\n50of greater than 5.0 g/kg was reported. Signs observed\\nin animals during the study included chromorhinorrhea in ﬁve ormore animals and isolated instances of the following: tachypnea,chromodacryorrhea, ptosis, lethargy, piloerection, emaciation,ataxia, and respiratory noise. Necropsy ﬁndings for the onlyanimal that died included abnormalities of the lungs, kidneys,liver, spleen, and gastrointestinal tract (Letizia et al. 2000).\\nThe Societe Bertin (1987) reported an acute oral toxicity\\nstudy in which Cire Essentielle Cassie (trade name for Aca-cia Farnesiana Flower Wax) was evaluated using groups of ﬁverats (males and females) of the OFA Sprague-Dawley IOPS\\nstrain. Mean weights for male and female test animals were219.60 g and 183.60 g, respectively. Control mean weightswere 224.0 g (males) and 183.80 g (females). The animalswere all approximately the same age (ages not stated). A sin-gle 10 ml/kg dose of the product was administered orally toeach animal, and followed by a 14-day observation period. Con-trol animals were dosed with corn oil (10 ml/kg). The animalswere killed at the end of the observation period and necropsyperformed.\\nSigniﬁcant changes in general condition (weight changes in-\\ncluded) or behavior between test and control animals were notobserved. None of the animals died and no test substance-related\\norgan lesions were observed. The test material was classiﬁed asinnocuous at the dose administered (Societe Bertin 1987).\\nBiogir S.A. Conseil Recherche (1990a) also reported the\\nacute oral toxicity of Cire Essentielle de ﬂeurs de Mimosa (tradename for Acacia Dealbata Leaf Wax) in a suspension with paraf-ﬁn oil using ﬁve male (178.3 ±9.8 g) and ﬁve female (172.8 ±\\n5.9 g) rats of the OFA Sprague-Dawley strain (SPF). The ani-mals were 2 months old. A single oral dose of 2 g/kg (10 ml/kg)of the product was administered to each animal by gavage, anddosing was followed by a 14-day observation period. Feedingresumed a t 4 h post dosing. At the end of the observation period,\\nthe animals were killed and gross necropsy performed.\\nWeight gain was described as normal and no deaths were\\nreported. Additionally, none of the animals had overt signs ofcentral nervous system or neurovegetative system toxicity, andno lesions of organs examined were noted at necropsy. The min-imal lethal dose was greater than 2 g/kg (Biogir S.A. ConseilRecherche 1990a).\\nAcute Dermal Toxicity\\nAcacia (Not Gum Arabic)\\nThe acute dermal toxicity of Acacia Farnesiana Extract (from\\nﬂowers) was evaluated using 10 rabbits (strain and weights notstated). A single dose of 5.0 g/kg was administered dermallyto each animal, and observations were made over a period of14 days. Gross necropsy was performed at the end of the obser-vation period. Signs observed during the study were as follows:isolated instances of lethargy, diarrhea, ptosis, and nasal dis-charge (yellow). Gross observations at necropsy were normalfor each animal. An LD\\n50of greater than 5.0 g/kg was reported\\n(Letizia et al. 2000). Skin irritation reactions observed in thisstudy are included in the section on Skin Irritation later in thereport text.\\nAcute Intraperitoneal Toxicity\\nGum Arabic\\nIn a study using dogs (number and weights not stated), the\\nintraperitoneal injection of 4.8 g/kg gum arabic did not inducetoxicity. However, the same dose killed dehydrated dogs (highestno-effect level =1.9 g/kg) (FASEB 1973).90 COSMETIC INGREDIENT REVIEW\\nShort-Term Oral Toxicity\\nGum Arabic\\nInformatics Inc. (1972) reported a study in which diets con-\\ntaining Gum Arabic were fed to 133 guinea pigs. Except for onediet containing 20% gum arabic, all of the diets contained 15%gum arabic. The animals were fed for periods ranging from threeto nine weeks. No toxic effects resulted from the administrationof gum arabic.\\nGroups of rats (number and weights not stated) were fed 15%\\ngum arabic in the diet for 62 days. A cathartic effect was noted.Weight gain, feed efﬁciency, hematological ﬁndings, and organweights were normal (World Health Organization 1974).\\nAnderson et al. (1984) fed three groups of three male Albino\\nWistar rats (weights =140 to 160 g) diets containing 1%, 4%,\\nand 8% ( w/w ) gum arabic (Acacia Senegal Gum), respectively,\\ndaily for 28 days. A fourth group served as the negative con-trol. At necropsy, hepatic and cardiac tissues were obtained forelectron microscopy and microsomal P-450 assays.\\nNo discernible ultrastructural differences were observed be-\\ntween the livers of test (all dietary groups) and control rats; par-ticularly, the mitochondria were normal. Also, no discernibleultrastructural differences were found between the hearts of test(all dietary groups) and control rats. Particularly, both the ap-\\npearance and concentration of the mitochondria and myoﬁbrils\\nwere identical in this comparison. The results of assays of hep-atic microsomal protein and cytochrome P-450 for each dietarygroup indicated that gum arabic did not cause inductive effects.The investigators noted that when induction by active agents(e.g., phenobarbitone) takes place, cytochrome P-450 values areincreased by several-fold within a few days (Anderson et al.1984).\\nAnderson et al. (1986) fed 10% ( w/w ) gum arabic (Acacia\\nSenegal Gum) daily for 45 days to Wistar albino rats (99 to\\n120 g). The number of rats in the study was not stated. The ratswere then killed by cervical dislocation while under ether anes-thesia. Portions of the jejunum, ileum, and cecum were excisedand the ultrastructure of each was evaluated using transmissionelectron microscopy.\\nNo abnormalities in organelles were observed within cells\\nof the jejunum, ileum, or cecum of rats fed gum arabic. Ad-ditionally, neither inclusions nor other pathological changes\\nwere detected. It was concluded that no signiﬁcant ultrastruc-\\ntural differences occurred between experimental and control rats(Anderson et al. 1986).\\nCook et al. (1992) evaluated the oral toxicity of gum arabic\\n(Acacia species not stated) using 3-week-old Sprague-Dawleyrats (16 males, 16 females). Three days before dosing, meanbody weights were 122 g and 125 g for males and females, re-spectively. The animals were fed gum arabic (dose not stated)\\ndaily for 28 days and then killed by exsanguination. Blood sam-\\nples were obtained for hematological examination and serumanalysis the day before animals were killed. Microscopic exam-ination of most organs was performed, which included exami-nation of any tissues that appeared abnormal.No treatment-related behavioral effects were noted. All val-\\nues for serum chemistry parameters were within the normal lim-its for laboratory rats. Mean red blood cell volume values weresaid to have been within the normal range for Sprague-Dawleyrats. No toxicologically signiﬁcant lesions were noted at micro-scopic examination (Cook et al. 1992).\\nShort-Term Intravenous Toxicity\\nGum Arabic\\nAcacia (Gum Arabic) was administered intravenously to\\nthree dogs (weights not stated) over a period of 76 days. Thenumber of intravenous injections ranged from 32 to 35 over thisperiod, and the range for the total cumulative dose was 15.7to 47.7 g/kg. An enlarged liver was observed in the dog that re-ceived the greatest cumulative dose; death occurred four monthsafter the last injection. The cause of death was not stated. Theremaining two dogs remained in good condition. The results ofbiopsies performed on the two animals indicated that Acaciawas present in the liver 26 months after the last injection (WorldHealth Organization 1974).\\nIn another study, gum arabic was administered intravenously\\nto dogs (number and weights not stated) over a period rangingfrom 1 to 84 days. Doses ranged from 1 to 2 g/kg. Enlarged liversand swollen kidneys were the most characteristic changes. Sim-ilar doses were fatal when administered to two rabbits (weightsnot stated) (FASEB 1973).\\nSubchronic Oral Toxicity\\nGum Arabic\\nAnderson et al. (1982) evaluated the subchronic oral toxicity\\nof gum arabic (Acacia Senegal Gum) in two experiments usingalbino Wistar rats (24 to 28 days old). Body weights prior toinitiation of the study were not included.\\nIn the ﬁrst experiment, groups of 15 male rats were fed\\ngum arabic at concentrations of 0.91% (dietary level =0.53 g/\\nkg/day), 2.0% (1.08 g/kg/day), 4.3% (2.55 g/kg/day), and 8.6%(5.22 g/kg/day), respectively, for 13 weeks. Groups of 15 fe-male rats were fed concentrations of 0.75% (0.5 g/kg/day), 1.7%(1.05 g/ kg/day), 3.7% (2.6 g/kg/day), and 7.5% (5.31/g/kg/day),respectively. Fifteen males and 15 females served as controls.\\nIn the second experiment, 15 male rats were fed gum arabic at\\nan average concentration of 18.6% (14 g/kg/day) for 13 weeks.Fifteen female rats were fed an average concentration of 18.1%\\n(13.8 g/kg/day). The two control groups consisted of 15 males\\nand 15 females, respectively. Urine and blood samples wereobtained during the study. The animals were killed under anes-thesia by cervical dislocation at the end of the treatment periodand prepared for necropsy.\\nThe results for the two experiments included the reported\\ndeaths of two control female rats. Growth rates were not reducedfor male or female rats at dietary doses up to 5 g/kg/day ( ∼8.5%\\ngum arabic in diet). At a concentration of approximately 18% inthe diet (14 g/kg/day), male rats had a reduced growth rate andACACIA 91\\nsmaller ﬁnal body weight ( p<.01). The average weight gain\\nfor male rats was 78% of that of controls.\\nFollowing the ingestion of gum arabic, 5 g/kg/day, by male\\nrats, kidney weights (absolute and relative to body weight) werereduced ( p<.05). At the highest dietary doses tested ( ∼18%,\\n14 g/kg/day), kidney weights for male and female rats weresigniﬁcantly reduced ( p<.01). Liver weight was reduced in\\na dose-dependent manner in male rats; the difference betweenexperimental and control groups was not signiﬁcant at doses ofgum arabic less than 5 g/kg/day. No signiﬁcant differences wereobserved in urine volume or composition between control andtest groups at any of the dietary concentrations of gum arabictested.\\nSimilarly, no signiﬁcant hematological changes were ob-\\nserved between test and control groups. At microscopic exam-ination, no alterations were found that were attributable to theingestion of gum arabic. The only treatment-related alterationnoted at necropsy was cecal enlargement in rats of the highest-\\ndose groups (Anderson et al. 1982).\\nIn another study, Anderson et al. (1984) fed four groups of ﬁve\\nmale albino Wistar rats (weights =40 to 60 g) diets containing\\n0.5%, 1.5%, 2.5%, and 3.5% ( w/w ) gum arabic (Acacia Senegal\\nGum), respectively, daily for 91 days. A ﬁfth group served as thenegative control. At the end of the feeding period, the animals\\nwere killed by cervical dislocation for necropsy. Samples ofliver and heart from each treatment group were obtained fortransmission electron microscopy. Livers from the remainingrats (two per group) were used for assays of microsomal proteinand cytochrome P-450.\\nElectron microscopic ﬁndings for cardiac muscle included no\\nabnormality of myoﬁlaments, no depletion of glycogen reserves,no abnormality of the intracytoplasmic mitochondria or endo-plasmic reticulum, no excessive inﬁltration with lipid, and noevidence of interstitial inﬁltration. Additionally, no abnormali-ties were observed with respect to the size, chromatin content, ornucleoli of nuclei. Electron microscopic ﬁndings for the liver in-cluded no abnormalities in hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, or liningcells of the biliary passages. The mitochondria and nuclei werenormal both in appearance and internal structure, and no ab-normalities were observed in intracytoplasmic glycogen stores(Anderson et al. 1984).\\nSkin Irritation\\nAcacia (Not Gum Arabic)\\nIn an acute dermal toxicity study, Acacia Farnesiana Ex-\\ntract (from ﬂowers) was administered dermally (single dose of5.0 g/kg) to 10 rabbits, after which animals were observed for\\n14 days. On day 1, moderate erythema and moderate edema\\nwere observed in all ten rabbits (Letizia et al. 2000).\\nBiogir S.A. Conseil Recherche (1990b) evaluated the skin ir-\\nritation potential of Cire Essentielle de ﬂeurs de Mimosa (tradename for Acacia Dealbata Leaf Wax) using six New Zealandalbino rabbits. The undiluted product (volume =0.5 ml on anocclusive patch) was applied to scariﬁed skin (clipped free of\\nhair) of the right ﬂank of each animal. The left ﬂank (nonscariﬁedskin) of each animal served as the control. Each patch was se-cured with a hypoallergenic, microporous adhesive strip and anelastic band (ﬁxed with adhesive tape) that was wrapped aroundthe trunk. Patches were removed after 24 h of contact.\\nAt 24 h and 72 h post application, reactions were scored\\naccording to the following grading scales: 0 (no erythema) to4 (severe erythema [crimson red] with or without eschar [deepinjuries] and lesions showing a serious cutaneous reaction suchas a burn, a necrosis) and 0 (no edema) to 4 (severe edema [morethan 1 mm thick and extending beyond the area of exposure]\\nshowing a serious cutaneous reaction such as a burn). Scores forerythema and edema (intact and scariﬁed skin) were determined\\nat 24 and 72 h post application. The scores (intact and scariﬁedskin) obtained were added together and divided by 24 to calculatethe primary cutaneous irritation index.\\nCire Essentielle de ﬂeurs de Mimosa (Acacia Dealbata Leaf\\nWax) was classiﬁed as a nonirritant (primary irritation in-dex=0.5) in New Zealand albino rabbits (Biogir S.A. Conseil\\nRecherche 1990b).\\nBertin Laboratories (1987) reported on a study in which\\nthe skin irritation potential of Cire Essentielle Cassie (AcaciaFarnesiana Flower Wax) was evaluated using six New Zealandrabbits. The test substance (in pure form, 0.5 ml under occlusivepad) was applied to intact and scariﬁed skin of the right and leftﬂank, respectively, that had been clipped free of hair. A stretchbandage was then wound around the torso of each animal andsecured with adhesive tape. Patches were removed at 24 h post\\napplication. Reactions were scored at 24 and 72 h post applica-\\ntion according to the following grading scales: 0 (no erythema)to 4 (serious erythema [purple red] with slight scarring [deeplesions] and 0 (no edema) to 4 (serious edema [over 1 mm thick]with a surface area greater than 1 mm\\n2).\\nAt 24 h, reactions at intact sites were described as some-\\nwhat pronounced erythema (2 rabbits [slight erythema, score =\\n1]; 1 rabbit [highly visible erythema, score =2]). V ery slight\\nedema (score =1, intact site) was also noted in the rabbit with\\nhighly visible erythema. Identical results were reported for scar-iﬁed skin sites. At 72 h, reactions were observed in one rabbit;slight erythema and very slight edema were observed at intactand scariﬁed sites. Cire Essentielle Cassie (Acacia FarnesianaFlower Wax) was classiﬁed as a slight skin irritant (primary\\ncutaneous irritation index =0.6) (Bertin Laboratories 1987).\\nPhototoxicity\\nAcacia (Not Gum Arabic)\\nThe phototoxicity of a 20% solution of Acacia Farnesiana\\nExtract (from ﬂowers) in methanol was evaluated using sixSKH:hairless mice. The test substance was applied to a 5-cm\\n2\\narea on the back of each animal. At 30 min post application, test\\nsites were irradiated with UV light for 1 h. The light source con-\\nsisted of a bank of six ﬂuorescent, black light lamps positioned92 COSMETIC INGREDIENT REVIEW\\nat a distance of 35 cm, or an Atlas xenon lamp (model Rm 60\\nor 65 [wavelength: 280 to 320 nm] with a Schott WG320 ﬁl-ter) positioned at a distance of 1 m. Reactions were scored at 4,24, 48, 72, and 96 h post exposure. No phototoxic effects wereobserved (Letizia et al. 2000).\\nImmunological Responses\\nStudies on immunological responses to gum arabic and Aca-\\ncia solution/extract are summarized in Table 9.\\nAcacia (Not Gum Arabic)\\nMaytum and Magath (1932) reported a series of three ex-\\nperiments that evaluated the allergenicity of an Acacia solution(exact composition not stated). In the ﬁrst experiment, six rabbits(12 weeks old) were injected intravenously with 50 cc Acacia,and this dose was repeated 5, 12, and 17 days later. At 4 weeksafter the last injection, each rabbit was injected intravenouslywith 2 cc of Acacia.\\nThe rabbits appeared normal during a 1-h observation period\\nfollowing this injection. On the same day, one of the rabbits wasinjected intravenously with 2 cc of a 50% egg white solution todetermine whether exposure to a foreign protein would result ingreater sensitivity to Acacia. Acacia (2 cc) was injected intra-venously 3 weeks later, and then 3 weeks after this injection ata dose of 15 cc. No signs of anaphylaxis were observed in thisanimal (Maytum and Magath 1932).\\nIn the second experiment, eight guinea pigs (weights =300 g)\\nwere injected intraperitoneally with a dose of 10 cc, and this dosewas repeated 5, 12, and 17 days later. At four weeks after thelast dose, two of the animals were injected intravenously with0.5 cc Acacia.\\nTypical anaphylactic signs (sneezing and coughing, scratch-\\ning the nose, and dyspnea) were noted in both guinea pigs afterapproximately 30 s. The two animals died approximately 3 minafter signs were ﬁrst noted. Two other guinea pigs were injectedintracardially with Acacia solution (0.5 cc; exact compositionnot stated), after which both had milder signs of anaphylaxis.One animal recovered, and the other died after 1 h. The remain-ing four guinea pigs each received an intraperitoneal injectionof Acacia solution (0.5 cc). Mild reactions were noted in two ofthe animals, and no signs were reported for the remaining two.\\nA follow-up third experiment was performed to determine\\nwhether the guinea pig deaths reported were due to the intra-venous method of test substance administration in the secondexperiment. Four guinea pigs were injected intravenously with0.5 cc Acacia solution (exact composition not stated), and nodeleterious effects were noted. Acacia solution (10 cc) was ad-ministered intraperitoneally to eight guinea pigs; four of theanimals died within ﬁve days after injection.\\nSeven days later, intraperitoneal injections of Acacia solu-\\ntion (10 cc) were given to the four remaining guinea pigs (fromsecond experiment) that were injected intraperitoneally, the fourguinea pigs that were injected intravenously in the ﬁrst exper-iment, and four new guinea pigs. Of the four new guinea pigs,\\ntwo died from peritonitis within 4 days.\\nSeven days after intraperitoneal injection, the remaining\\n10 animals from the third experiment were injected intraperi-toneally with 10 cc Acacia. Four of the 10 died of peritonitison the next day. It was stated that Acacia was capable of in-\\nducing peritonitis (followed by death) only after intraperitoneal\\nadministration.\\nIn total, these authors reported on the results of studies in-\\nvolving a total of 19 guinea pigs (8 guinea pigs from preced-ing experiment included) that include sensitization induced byAcacia solution (administered parenterally; exact compositionnot stated) and no anaphylactic signs developed in seven of the\\nanimals.\\nMild and moderate anaphylactic signs developed in four and\\nthree guinea pigs, respectively, and severe signs were noted intwo guinea pigs. Three of the 19 guinea pigs died. In addressingthe results from the preceding experiments, the investigatorsnoted that anaphylactic sensitivity to Acacia can develop undercertain unusual conditions. It was also stated that no dangerwas associated with an initial dose of Acacia if the solutionwas properly prepared; however, subsequent doses administeredafter at least 3 weeks should be given cautiously because ofthe possibility of anaphylactic reactions (Maytum and Magath1932).\\nAronson and McMaster (1972) sensitized 12 guinea pigs\\n(strain not stated; weights ≈300 g) via single intra-abdominal\\ninjections of 600 mg Acacia (6% solution, 10 ml; compositionof solution and Acacia species not stated). The animals werechallenged 1 month later with an intravenous injection of 60 mgof the sensitizing sample or other samples of Acacia.\\nThe nonnecrotizing toxicity of Acacia extract was evaluated\\nusing germ-free and conventional guinea pigs of the Hartleystrain. The ages of the germ-free animals tested were as fol-lows: group A (12 animals, 8 days old), group B (9 animals, 3weeks old), and group C (6 animals, 12 weeks old). The testsubstance (40 mg/ml) was suspended in phosphate buffer (pH7.4, 0.1 M) and applied topically to the cornea of the right eye;phosphate buffer was applied to the cornea of the left eye. Forboth substances, one drop was applied every half hour for a totalof seven applications.\\nThe following three groups of conventional guinea pigs were\\nalso treated according to the same procedure: group 1 (six an-imals, 8 days old), group 2 (seven animals, 12 weeks old), andgroup 3 (two animals, 7 months old). All animals were killed30 min after application of the last drop. Additionally, phosphatebuffer was instilled into both eyes of two animals (killed when\\n8 days old), and the same was true for two other animals (killedwhen 3 weeks old). The eyes were enucleated immediately after\\nall animals were killed. The animals were bled prior to killing,and serum samples were subsequently obtained for determina-tion of antibody or y-globulin. At microscopic examination, asevere inﬂammatory response was observed in both germ-freeand conventional 8-day-old guinea pigs.TABLE 9\\nImmunological responses\\nTest substance Animals tested Test procedure Results Reference\\nAcacia solution 6 rabbits (12 weeks old) Four i.v. injections (50 cc) on days 0, 5, 12, and\\n17, followed by single i.v. injection (2 cc) 4weeks after fourth injectionNo signs of anaphylaxis Maytum and\\nMagath 1932\\nAcacia solution 8 guinea pigs (weights =\\n300 g)Four i.p. injections (10 cc) on days 0, 5, 12, and\\n17 followed by single i.v. injection (0.5 cc) 4\\nweeks after fourth injectionAnaphylactic signs (sneezing, coughing,\\ndyspnea) in 8 animals; 2 deaths.\\nMilder signs noted in 2 survivinganimals injected intracardially (0.5\\ncc); 1 died.

In the 7-month-old conventional animals, the responses were much moresevere than that noted for 12-week-old germ-free animals. Thiscomparison was made because 7-month-old germ-free animalswere not available.\\nThe inﬂammatory response to Acacia was most severe in the\\nconjunctiva and the subconjunctival tissues were relatively freeof inﬂammatory changes. Swelling of superﬁcial epithelial cellsof the central cornea and necrosis of a few of these cells werealso observed. The severity of inﬂammatory responses was cor-related with serum y-globulin concentrations. The extent of theinﬂammation induced by Acacia paralleled y-globulin concen-\\ntrations in germ-free guinea pigs more closely than in conven-\\ntional guinea pigs (Aronson and McMaster 1972).\\nGum Arabic\\nFive guinea pigs (weights =300 to 450 g) were passively sen-\\nsitized with 2 ml of anti-Gum Acacia rabbit serum via intraperi-toneal injection. At 24 to 36 h post injection, an intravenous doseof a homologous gum (1 mg) was administered to each animal,\\nand the animals were observed for signs of anaphylaxis. Three\\nguinea pigs died 2 to 3 min after intravenous administration,and the remaining two slowly recovered from shock during thefollowing 2 t o3h( P artridge and Morgan 1942).\\nRice (1954a) evaluated the effect of Gum Acacia (species\\nnot stated) on complement and antibody production using twogroups of 10 guinea pigs (strain not stated; weights =600 to\\n1000 g). The animals were injected subcutaneously with gumarabic (7% solution, 5 ml) on alternate days prior to and dur-ing immunization; gum arabic was injected repeatedly over aperiod of seven weeks. After 2 weeks of dosing, the animalswere bled and injected intraperitoneally with 1 ml of Brucella\\nabortus vaccine. Three additional injections of this vaccine were\\nmade 4 days (2-ml injection), 8 days (3 ml), and 21 days (3 ml)later.\\nThe guinea pigs were bled again one week after the third and\\nfourth doses of vaccine, and all sera were titrated for hemolyticcomplement and for agglutinative and complement-ﬁxing ac-tivity with Brucella abortus antigens. Surviving animals were\\nretested for 6 weeks, bled again, injected with a ﬁfth dose ofvaccine, and bled for a fourth time 7 days later. Twenty guinea\\npigs of comparable weight were included in each of the controlgroups (immunized and non-immunized).\\nA sharp decline in complement titers was noted in both groups\\nof guinea pigs injected with Gum Acacia. Following seven in-jections, only 2 of 18 surviving guinea pigs had complementtiters over 1000 units per ml (minimum titer =455). After 14\\ninjections, one of the remaining animals had a titer that ap-\\nproached normal (minimum titer =385). During the ensuing\\nperiod, a rise in complement titer to over 1000 units per mlwas noted for ﬁve guinea pigs and complement titers below500 units were noted for eight guinea pigs; the reason for thesechanges in titer was undetermined. In addition to the reductionsin complement titer noted in the two groups, antibody and total\\nserum protein production were also reduced. It was determinedthat no deleterious effects on antibody production resulted, asjudged by the development of agglutinative and complement-ﬁxing activity in the sera to the bacterial antigen Brucella abortus\\n(Rice 1954a).\\nRice (1954a) also evaluated the effect of Gum Acacia (species\\nnot stated) on complement and antibody production using fourrabbits (weight range =1800 to 2650 g). This experiment is from\\nthe study summarized in the preceding paragraph. The rabbitswere injected subcutaneously with a 7% solution of Gum Acacia(10 ml) every other day for 4 weeks. All rabbits were bled on the\\n15th day and immunized with 1 ml Brucella abortus vaccine.\\nThe vaccine was also injected 4 and 8 days later in 2-ml and 3-mlvolumes, respectively. The rabbits were bled again seven daysafter the third dose of vaccine. Untreated rabbits (immunized)and nonimmunized rabbits served as controls.\\nIn contrast to the effects noted in guinea pigs in the preced-\\ning study, Gum Acacia did not appreciably lower complement\\nactivity. The authors concluded that no deleterious effects on\\nantibody production resulted, as judged by the development ofagglutination and complement-ﬁxing activity in the sera to thebacterial antigen Brucella abortus (Rice 1954a).\\nIn another study, Rice (1954b) evaluated complement titers\\nin guinea pigs (strain and weights not stated) that were eitheractively or passively sensitized to a 7% solution of Gum Acacia.Ten guinea pigs were injected subcutaneously with 16 doses(5 ml per dose) of a 7% Gum Acacia (species not stated) solutionover a period of 16 days. The animals were actively sensitized\\nafter 7 doses, and the nine survivors were bled, challenged, and\\nrebled in 3 weeks.\\nSigns of asphyxia were reported for one of the nine survivors;\\nthis animal survived for more than 3 h. The other guinea pigsbecame excited shortly after challenge, running around wildlyand squealing (shock signs); two eventually died. An additional10 guinea pigs that had received 11 injections of Gum Acaciasolution were passively sensitized, bled, and challenged 48 hlater. Typical respiratory signs developed; none of the animals\\ndied. No signiﬁcant decline in serum-complement activity was\\ndetected in animals challenged shortly after passive sensitizationor in actively sensitized Gum Acacia-treated guinea pigs; how-ever, a decline in this activity was noted. Additionally, in bothsensitized groups, initial excitement followed by fatigue andweakness were the most striking clinical signs (Rice 1954b).\\nSilvette et al. (1955) reported that anaphylactic shock resulted\\nin each of the 12 guinea pigs sensitized via intra-abdominalinjection of 160 mg Acacia with Freund’s complete adjuvant(FCA) (2 ml of emulsion containing two parts 20% Acacia).Ten guinea pigs died. Two additional guinea pigs were sensi-tized via intra-abdominal injection of 160 mg Acacia with FCA(2 ml of emulsion containing two parts 20% Acacia). This Aca-cia sample was from another lot. The animals were challengedintravenously with 60 mg Acacia 1 month later. Typical anaphy-lactic death was reported for both guinea pigs.ACACIA 97\\nThe results of this experiment as well as additional experi-\\nments (rabbits and guinea pigs) in this study collectively indi-cated that four different lots of Gum Acacia were equally ef-fective as immunizing, sensitizing, and anaphylactogenic anddesensitizing antigens, based on the results of cross-precipitintests and cross-anaphylaxis experiments (Silvette et al. 1955).\\nAntibodies directed against gum arabic (species not stated)\\nhave been isolated using afﬁnity chromatography on AH-Sepharose 4B containing gum arabic ligands. These antibodieswere induced in rabbits immunized with gum arabic in FCA. Itwas determined that the antibodies were anti-carbohydrate anti-bodies with speciﬁcity for certain carbohydrate units of the gumarabic. The results of chemical modiﬁcation and inhibition ex-periments indicated that 4- α-\\nL-arabinofuranosyl- D-glucuronic\\nacid units of the polysaccharide were the major immunodeter-minant groups (Pazur et al. 1986).\\nBlood group antigens have been demonstrated in gum arabic\\n(species not stated). The following substances were identiﬁedusing an agglutinin inhibition test of mild hydrolyzed gum ara-bic: B, C (of ABO blood group system) and H substances (of Hblood group system) and Le\\na(Lewisaantigen, in Lewis blood\\ngroup system). The results of a revised latex agglutination tech-nique indicated the presence of P and S (of MN blood groupsystem) as well as the substances mentioned in the precedingstatement. Elution processes, using sensitized and agglutinatedlatex or kaolin particles, resulted in the identiﬁcation of B, H,and Le\\nasubstances in gum arabic; the elution of anti-P and anti-S\\ndid not occur (Matsuzawa 1968).\\nNarita (1985) reported the isolation of high-titer anti-Gum\\nArabic sera obtained from rabbits injected with gum arabic(species not stated). The antisera had cross-reactivity with theLewis\\naantigen (Lea), as measured by both a single diffusion\\ntube test and the Ouchterlony test (Narita 1985).\\nStrobel et al. (1982) evaluated the allergenicity of three grades\\nof gum arabic using female CBA mice (6 weeks old; six toeight mice per group). The grades of gum arabic tested wereas follows: (1) processed gum arabic recovered by spray-dryingfrom a solution of commercial food grade gum arabic after ﬁl-tration to remove sand, etc., and after heat treatment to effectpasteurization; (2) ﬁnely powdered natural gum arabic of poorcommercial quality giving solutions of a dark red-brown color;(3) ﬁnely powdered natural gum arabic of very high quality,giving essentially colorless solutions.\\nThe gum exudates were dissolved in 0.15 M NaCl at a concen-\\ntration of 4 mg/ml by incubation at 37\\n◦C for 16 h. The resulting\\nsolution was sterilized by irradiation. The mice were immunizedby injection of the antigen (0.1 mg in 0.05 ml of FCA) intothe left hind footpad. At 21 days after primary immunization,delayed-type hypersensitivity was measured using a skin test. Inthis test, the antigen (0.1 mg dissolved in 0.15 M saline in vol-ume of 0.05 ml) was injected intradermally into the plantar sideof the right footpad of anesthetized mice. Using a micro caliper,footpad thickness was measured in triplicate immediately be-fore intradermal injection and 24 h later. For controls, footpadswelling was measured before and after antigen injection into\\nthe footpad of nonimmunized mice, and before and after salineinjection into the footpad of immunized mice. All mice werekilled one week after the skin tests. The animals were bled andserum separated and decomplemented.\\nThe intradermal injection of antigen into nonimmunized, con-\\ntrol mice (four mice per antigen) did not induce signiﬁcant foot-pad swelling at 24 h. Similarly, the intradermal injection of salineinto immunized control mice did not cause a signiﬁcant increasein footpad thickness. However, compared to the control, signif-icant positive responses were noted in mice of the test groups(p<.01), indicating an antigen-speciﬁc hypersensitivity re-\\naction for all three gum arabic specimens that were tested. Acomparison of results for the three grades of gum arabic indi-cated that footpad swelling in mice immunized and tested withthe dark, red-brown grade was signiﬁcantly greater ( p<.005)\\nwhen compared to the colorless grade (Strobel et al. 1982).\\nStrobel and Ferguson (1986) studied the immunological ac-\\ntivity of gum arabic (species not stated) using two groups ofeight female BDF1 [(C57BL/6] ×DBA/2)F\\n1] mice (6 to 8 weeks\\nold). A ﬁnely powdered sample of gum arabic was dissolved in0.15 M saline at a concentration of 400 mg/ml. Each of eightmice was then dosed with gum arabic (80 mg) by intragastricadministration. Control mice were dosed with saline. At 7 days\\npost dosing, the mice were immunized by injecting a salinesolution of 100 μg gum arabic emulsiﬁed in an equal volume\\nof FCA (total volume injected =0.05 ml) into the left hind\\nfootpad.\\nControl mice were immunized with 0.15 M saline in FCA.\\nPrior to and 3 weeks after immunization all mice were bled anddecomplemented sera were tested for anti-Gum Arabic antibod-ies by a micro-ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay)technique.\\nDelayed-type hypersensitivity was also measured (skin test)\\nat 3 weeks post immunization. The mice were anesthetized and0.1 mg gum arabic (in volume of 0.05 ml) was injected intrader-mally into the right footpad. Footpad thickness was measuredin triplicate immediately before intradermal injection and 24 hlater. As controls, footpad swelling was measured before and af-ter gum arabic was injected into the footpad of saline/adjuvant-immunized animals, as well as before and after saline was in-jected into the footpad of mice immunized with gum arabic.\\nFootpad swelling was negligible in both control groups. An-\\ntibodies were not detected in the serum of mice that were bledbefore systemic immunization. Serum antibodies were identiﬁedin ﬁve of eight control (saline prefed) mice after systemic im-munization. However, antibodies were not detected in the serumof mice that were prefed with gum arabic. Regarding delayed-type hypersensitivity, a similar pattern was noted. Positive skintests were reported for all saline-prefed mice. However, foot-pad swelling in mice prefed with gum arabic was signiﬁcantlysuppressed. Test results indicated that systemic immunologicalhyporesponsiveness (oral tolerance) developed in mice that werefed gum arabic (Strobel and Ferguson 1986).98 COSMETIC INGREDIENT REVIEW\\nStrobel (1986) evaluated the immunogenicity, cross-\\nreactivity, and nonspeciﬁc irritant properties of gum arabic (Aca-cia Senegal Gum) using male mice (6 to 8 weeks old) of the[(C57BL/6J ×DBA/2F\\n1] (BDF 1) strain. Nonspeciﬁc irritant\\nproperties were assessed in the foot pad swelling test using con-trol groups of nonimmunized mice. Immunogenicity was evalu-ated in an in vivo footpad swelling test, and cross-reactivity wasassessed by secondary antibody response.\\nThe following gum arabic samples (identiﬁed as samples A,\\nB, C, D, and E) were tested in each experiment: (1) SampleA (sodium arabate) resulted from the neutralization of sampleC with sodium hydroxide. (2) Sample B resulted from three\\nsuccessive precipitations of sample C from aqueous solutionwith acidiﬁed ethanol. (3) Sample C, gum arabic, was a water-\\nsoluble polysaccharide containing rhamnose, arabinose, glu-curonic acid, and galactose. (4) Sample D was deﬁned as pow-dered food grade natural gum arabic. (5) Sample E was obtainedby exhaustive ethanolic extraction of sample D. In the nonspe-ciﬁc footpad swelling test, ﬁve groups (six to eight mice pergroup) of nonimmunized male mice were injected intradermally\\nwith the ﬁve samples, respectively.\\nSample A did not induce signiﬁcant swelling at 24 h; how-\\never, samples B, C, and D increased, but only slightly, nonspe-ciﬁc swelling ( p<.05). Sample E induced the greatest extent\\nof footpad swelling. These results (footpad swelling) were in-dicative of a nonspeciﬁc irritant effect.\\nIn a second experiment, ﬁve groups (30 to 40 mice per\\ngroup) of mice were immunized with the ﬁve gum arabic sam-ples (200 μg per sample), respectively, in the left hind footpad.\\nEach gum arabic sample was emulsiﬁed in FCA prior to immu-\\nnization. Control mice (30 to 40 mice) were immunized withsaline in FCA. At 21 days post immunization, the presence ofdelayed-type hypersensitivity (speciﬁc cell mediated immunity)was measured in the footpad swelling skin test.\\nAll gum arabic samples were immunogenic in this test. In\\neach case, intradermal challenge after immunization caused asigniﬁcant increase in footpad thickness at 24 h. In the test forcross-reactivity, blood samples were obtained from mice thathad been immunized and tested (footpad swelling test) 3 weeks\\nafter immunization. Antibodies were assayed by an ELISA.\\nAssay results indicated that antigens were shared between\\nall of the samples, except for sample E. Mice immunized withsample A had signiﬁcant reactions when tested with samples A,B, C, and D. The greatest nonspeciﬁc swelling was produced bysamples B and C (Strobel et al. 1986).\\nGENOTOXICITY\\nGum Arabic\\nBoth in vitro and in vivo studies on the mutagenicity of gum\\narabic described as gum arabic, Acacia, or Gum Acacia are\\nsummarized in Table 10. Although a few positive results are\\ndescribed, most studies were negative for genotoxicity.UV Damage Repair\\nAcacia (Not Gum Arabic)\\nJain et al. (1987) evaluated the effect of Acacia arabica on\\nUV-induced damage in the WP-2 strain of Escherichia coli . Cul-\\ntures were irradiated with UV light (1.5 J/m\\n2/s) for 15 s, with\\nintermittent stirring. The bark of Acacia arabica was extracted\\nwith methanol and the extract was added to cultures at a con-\\ncentration of 5 mg/plate. The revertants and viable cells werecounted after incubation for two days at a temperature of 37\\n◦C.\\nCompared to control cultures exposed to UV light (mean\\nnumber of revertants per plate =216), the mutagenic activity\\nof UV light was reduced in cultures dosed with Acacia arabica\\nextract. The mean number of revertants per plate in test cultureswas 34. The survival for control and test cultures was 100% and70.6%, respectively. The investigators stated that the decrease in\\nUV-induced mutagenicity in the presence of Acacia could havebeen due to some enzymatic action that reverted the formationof pyrimidine dimers (Jain et al. 1987).\\nEffect on Genotoxicity of Other Agents\\nGum Arabic\\nThe effect of 3% gum arabic (solvent) on the mutagenicity of\\n4-nitroquinoline- N-oxide was evaluated using results from the\\nbone marrow micronucleus assay. Based on an analysis of time-response and dose-response data on 4-nitro-quinoline- N-oxide,\\nit was determined that the mutagenicity of this chemical was sixtimes greater in gum arabic when compared to test results for thechemical in DMSO. When the mutagenicity of other chemicals,such as mitomycin C, was evaluated using different solvents, nosolvent effect on mutagenicity was observed. The investigatorsconcluded that no clear relationship existed between the solventused and the mutagenicity observed (Katz et al. 1981).\\nCarcinogenicity\\nGum Arabic\\nNo evidence of carcinogenicity was noted in rats dosed in-\\ntraperitoneally with gum arabic (1.75% or 7% in saline or wa-ter) three times per week for up to 15 weeks. Based on the datapresented, it was difﬁcult to ascertain the size of the dose ad-ministered. The doses administered were on the order of severalhundred mg/kg. Also, no evidence of carcinogenicity was foundin a similar study using mice (doses injected not stated) (FASEB1973).\\nGum arabic gruel was injected intramediastinally (single\\ndose) into ﬁve (0.5 ml dose of test substance) and 10 (1 ml dose)guinea pigs. The animals (strain not speciﬁed) ranged in weightfrom 220 to 450 g and were 4 to 10 months old. Neoplasms werenot observed in any of the guinea pigs either at necropsy or atmicroscopic examination of tissue. On the average, the animalssurvived from 1200 to 1490 days (Tlolka-Pluszczyk 1970).\\nMelnick et al. (1983) studied the carcinogenicity of gum\\narabic using 4-week-old F344 rats (50 males, 50 females) andTABLE 10\\nIn vitro and in vivo mutagenicity of Gum Arabic, as Gum Arabic, Acacia, and Gum Acacia\\nTest substance Strains/cells/animals tested Test procedure Test results References\\nGum Arabic\\nBacterial Cell Test Systems\\nGum Arabic Saccharomyces cerevisiae\\nD4Host-mediated assay for mitotic\\nrecombination (Gabridge and Legator1969); test concentration of 5% w/v if no\\nlethal effects observedNot mutagenic Maxwell and Newell\\n1974\\nGum Arabic Salmonella typhimurium\\nG-46 and TA-1530Ames test (Ames 1971) Not mutagenic Maxwell and Newell\\n1974\\nGum Arabic (in\\nDMSO)Salmonella typhimurium\\nTA1535, TA1537, andTA1538\\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae\\nD4Plate and suspension assays with and\\nwithout metabolic activation.

Both male and female rats were dividedinto high- and low-dose groups. Low-dose animals were fedgum arabic at a concentration of 25,000 ppm in the diet andhigh-dose animals were fed 50,000 ppm. Test diets were fedfor 103 consecutive weeks, followed by 1 to 2 weeks of feed-ing of the basal diet. Control mice (50 males, 50 females) andrats (50 males, 50 females) were fed the basal diet only accord-ing to the same schedule. Moribund animals and animals thatsurvived to the end of the study were killed using carbon diox-ide and necropsied. Tissues were preserved for histopathologicevaluation.\\nChanges in mean body weight for male and female rats were\\ncomparable to those of the respective control groups throughout\\nthe study. Slight decreases in body weight (7% to 13%) wereobserved in female rats. Compared to controls, consistent dif-ferences in mean body weight were noted for female mice of thehigh dose group (50,000 ppm in diet). No signiﬁcant differenceswere found in survival between experimental mice or rats whencompared to the respective control groups.\\nNeoplasms were observed only in male rats, and were\\ndiagnosed as malignant lymphomas or leukemia/lymphoma.\\nThe incidences of malignant lymphomas for control, low-dose(25,000 ppm gum arabic), and high-dose (50,000 ppm gum ara-bic) experimental groups of male rats were as follows: 4/50(low-dose), 1/50 (high-dose), 8/50 (concurrent controls), and31/1066 (historical controls). Compared to the concurrent con-trol group, a signiﬁcant decrease ( p<.05) in tumor incidence\\nwas observed in the high dose group, and this was the onlystatistically signiﬁcant ﬁnding for this neoplasm.\\nThe incidences of neoplasms classiﬁed as leukemia/\\nlymphoma in control, low-dose (25,000 ppm gum arabic),and high-dose (50,000 ppm gum arabic) groups of male ratswere: 19/50 (low-dose), 16/50 (high-dose), 18/50 (concurrentcontrols), and 238/1066 (historical controls). Compared toconcurrent controls, no statistically signiﬁcant differences wereobserved in the incidence of tumors of this type.\\nNo signiﬁcant changes were observed in the incidence of\\nprimary neoplasms in mice that were fed gum arabic in thediet at concentrations of 25,000 or 50,000 ppm. Based on thepreceding results, the investigators concluded that gum arabicwas not carcinogenic in F344 rats or B6C3F\\n1mice of either sex\\n(Melnick et al. 1983).\\nCocarcinogenicity\\nGum Arabic\\nV ogel and Zaldivar (1971) studied the cocarcinogenicity of\\nGum Acacia using male rats of the Buffalo strain (6 to 10 weeksold). Thirty-four rats were exposed to ﬁssion neutrons (single\\nexposure of 300 to 364 rads; whole-body irradiation), followedby three intraperitoneal injections (0.5 ml per injection) of a7% solution of Gum Acacia in 0.85% sodium chloride weeklyfor 23 weeks.A second test group (30 rats) was irradiated after treatment\\nwith Gum Acacia according to the same procedure. Three groupsof rats served as controls: one of the control groups (50 rats) wasexposed to ﬁssion neutrons only. Two additional control groupsconsisted of 40 rats injected intraperitoneally with 7% GumAcacia only (according to test group protocol) and an untreatedcontrol group of 79 rats.\\nNo signiﬁcant neoplasm incidence was present in the two\\ncontrol groups. However, the survival time for the 40 controlrats injected with Gum Acacia (554.8 ±39.4 days, n=30)\\nwas signiﬁcantly shortened when compared to untreated controls(669.2 ±19.0 days, n=58). Increases in hepatic, gastric, and\\nintestinal neoplasms were noted in the ﬁrst test group (34 rats;neutron exposure followed by Gum Acacia injections), whencompared to the group of 50 rats exposed to ﬁssion neutrons only.\\nExcept for gastric neoplasms, these differences in neoplasm\\nincidence were considered small and probably not signiﬁcant.It is important to note that no gastric neoplasms were observedin the 50 rats exposed to ﬁssion neutrons only, whereas, 20%of the 34 test rats had gastric cancers. No explanation for this\\ndifference was given.\\nTissues of 28 of the 34 test rats in this group were subjected\\nto complete histopathological analysis after necropsy. Similarly(compared to ﬁssion neutrons control group), no gastric neo-plasms were noted in the group of 30 rats treated with GumAcacia and then exposed to ﬁssion neutrons. The investigatorsstated that this ﬁnding could have been due to the small numberof rats ( n=14, compared to n=28 in other test group) sub-\\njected to complete histopathological examination after necropsy.\\nThe authors stated that the data presented in this study sug-\\ngest that Gum Acacia might be considered a “potentiator” for\\ncarcinogenesis (V ogel and Zaldivar 1971).\\nGum arabic has been reported to increase the number of\\nmetastases in mice injected intraperitoneally with Ehrlich as-cites carcinoma cells. The carcinoma cells were injected 6 or 24h after the mice were injected intravenously with gum arabic.However, under some conditions, ascites tumor formation wasinhibited (Osswald 1968).\\nREPRODUCTIVE AND DEVELOPMENTAL TOXICITY\\nGum Arabic\\nStudies on the reproductive and developmental toxicity of\\ngum arabic are summarized in Table 11 and discussed below.\\nThe antifertility activity of Gum Acacia (1 ml in water) was\\nevaluated using 10 female rats (strain and weights not stated).The test substance was administered by stomach tube daily fora period of 5 days after mating.

Three\\nof the test groups consisted of 22 to 23 mice per group and re-ceived doses of 16, 75, and 350 mg/kg, respectively, on days 6through 15 of gestation. Doses were administered by oral intuba-tion. The fourth test group of 31 mice was dosed with gum arabic(1600 mg/kg) according to the same procedure. Sham-treatedmice (28) served as negative controls, and positive-control micewere dosed with aspirin (150 mg/kg). Mean body weights forthe test groups ranged from 30 to 39.7 g and were 31.2 g and31.8 g for negative and positive controls, respectively.\\nOn day 17, all dams were placed under anesthesia and ce-\\nsarean section was performed. The numbers of implantationsites, resorption sites, and live and dead fetuses were recorded.\\nThe urogenital tract of each dam was examined in detail for\\nanatomical normality. Gross examinations for the presence ofexternal congenital abnormalities were performed on all fe-tuses. Detailed visceral examinations employing 10 ×magniﬁ-\\ncation were performed on one-third of the fetuses from eachlitter. The remaining two-thirds were examined for skeletaldefects.\\nThe administration of gum arabic to pregnant mice at doses\\nup to 1600 mg/kg had no clearly discernible effect on nidation\\nor maternal or fetal survival. The number of abnormalitiesobserved in either soft or skeletal tissues of fetuses from testgroups did not differ from the number occurring spontaneouslyin sham-treated controls.\\nAs part of this study, groups of rats, rabbits, and hamsters were\\ndosed with gum arabic according to the following modiﬁcationsof the above test procedure: doses (indicated above) were admin-istered to hamsters (gestation days 6 through 10), rats (gestationdays 6 through 15), and rabbits (gestation days 6 through 18).Cesarean sections were performed earlier on hamsters (day 14)and later on rats (day 20). Positive-control rats and hamsters re-ceived a higher dose of aspirin (250 mg/kg). Rabbits were dosedwith gum arabic in corn oil (8, 37, 173, and 800 mg/kg, respec-tively); cesarean sections were performed on day 29. Rabbitswere injected with human chorionic gonadotropin (day 0) andartiﬁcially inseminated. Mean weights for the dams tested wereas follows: 200 to 216 g (24 rats per group), 104.6 to 118.4 g(21 to 24 hamsters per group), and 2.01 to 2.43 kg (15 rabbitsper group).\\nThe administration of gum arabic, in corn oil, to pregnant\\nrabbits at doses up to 37 mg/kg (highest dose tested =800\\nmg/kg) had no clear effect on nidation or maternal or fetal sur-vival. The number and types of abnormalities observed in fe-tal soft or skeletal tissues from this group did not differ fromthe number occurring spontaneously in the sham-treated con-trols. Of the four test groups of rabbits (15 dams per group), thenumber of survivors per dose group was reported as follows:13 rabbits (8.0 mg/kg dose group), 15 rabbits (37.0 mg/kg),12 rabbits (173.0 mg/kg), and 9 rabbits (800.0 mg/kg). In 173and 800 mg/kg dose groups, maternal death was preceded bysevere bloody diarrhea, urinary incontinence, and anorexia. Atnecropsy, hemorrhage in the mucosa of the small intestines wasthe only gross pathological ﬁnding (Food and Drug Research\\nLaboratories 1972).\\nAkbarsha and Manivannan (1993) studied the reproductive\\ntoxicity of Gum Acacia using two groups of ﬁve male albino\\nrats of the Wistar strain (4 months old; weights between 180and 200 g). The test substance was administered orally (dose =\\n1 ml) to the ﬁrst group daily for 24 days. The second group wasdosed (dose =1 ml) daily for 48 days. Rats in both groups were\\nnecropsied 24 h after the last dose.\\nThe testis, epididymis (divided into caput and cauda), semi-\\nnal vesicle, ventral prostate, and coagulating gland were excised,homogenized, and centrifuged. The supernatant was used for de-termination of total protein and acid phosphatase (ACPase) andalkaline phosphatase (ALPase) activities. Supernatant obtainedfrom the testes was also used for the determination of glycogenand cholesterol, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity.\\nThe authors stated that increased glycogen and LDH in the\\ntestis are both consequences of spermatogenic arrest, and thatdecreased ACPase and increased ALPase activities in the testis\\nalso reﬂect the suppression of spermatogenesis. They concluded\\nthat Gum Acacia did not suppress spermatogenesis in this study(Akbarsha and Manivannan 1993).\\nHuynh et al. (2000) used gum arabic as the vehicle control in a\\nstudy evaluating the effect of triptolide (deterpene triepoxide) onspermatogenesis in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (12 animals,90 days old). Control males were fed 30% gum arabic in the dietdaily for 82 days. Males in the test group were each fed triptolideat a daily dose of 100 μg/kg body weight. Male and female\\nrats (two females per male) were housed together during thefeeding period, after which pregnancy rates were determined.\\nThe presence of sperm in morning vaginal smears was used todetermine whether or not mating was successful. Any male thatimpregnated at least one of the females was considered fertile.All 12 control males were fertile, whereas all males fed triptolidein the diet were sterile.\\nCollins et al. (1987) evaluated the teratogenicity of gum ara-\\nbic (Acacia Senegal Gum) using groups of 4-week-old Osborne-Mendel (FDA strain) rats. Beginning at 13 weeks prior to mat-ing, the rats were fed gum arabic at concentrations of 1%, 2%,4%, 7.5%, or 15%, respectively. Another group of rats was feda control diet. Control and test diets were also fed throughoutmating and gestation. After mating was conﬁrmed, females wereplaced in groups of 41 to 47. The dams were killed on day 20 ofgestation.\\nOne female rat (1% dietary group) died during the study. Ex-\\nternal observations of the dams were unremarkable. One female(7.5% dietary group) did have a cystic ovary and one had lungnodules (15% dietary group). Sporadic nonsigniﬁcant increasesin body weight were observed in all experimental groups.\\nThe percentage of pregnant females was approximately the\\nsame in all experimental groups and controls. Mean numbersof corpora lutea and implants per female were also similar tocontrol values, and the average number of viable fetuses wassimilar in all groups. No effect was seen in any group withACACIA 107\\nrespect to the mean number of viable males and females. Three\\nlitters were totally resorbed, one litter from the control, 1%, and4% dietary groups. Gum arabic in the diet had no effect on thepercentage of females with at least one resorption or with at leasttwo resorptions. The numbers of early and late deaths, singly orcombined (as average percentage of resorptions), were similarto control values.\\nThe feeding of gum arabic had no effect on mean fetal body\\nweights and crown-rump lengths. The ingestion of gum ara-bic also had no effect on the distribution of fetuses by sex. Asigniﬁcant decrease in mean female body weight in the 1% di-etary group was noted; however, this observation was deemeda random occurrence. The signiﬁcant increase in the length offemales in the 4% and 7.5% dietary groups was not consideredbiologically signiﬁcant.\\nThe investigators stated that because of the large group of\\nanimals in this study, small variations in crown-rump length canresult in signiﬁcant effects. Similar numbers of runts were notedamong male and female fetuses from all dietary groups, with theexception of no runts among male fetuses in the 1% and 15%dietary groups.\\nRegarding external variations in live fetuses, spina biﬁda\\nand exencephaly were observed in two fetuses from the con-trol group. No other terata were observed, and the external vari-\\nations were distributed randomly. Similar numbers of fetuseswith hemorrhages were observed in all dietary groups.\\nThe mean numbers of sternebral variations per litter var-\\nied from 4.18 (4% gum arabic dietary group) to 5.09 (15%dietary group) in experimental groups, and the mean numberof sternebral variations per litter in the control group was 5.21.The variations included reduced ossiﬁcation and bipartite, miss-ing, and malaligned sternebrae. No dose-related increases werefound with respect to any of the observed sternebral deﬁciencies,and no signiﬁcant differences were found between experimentaland control groups. The signiﬁcant decrease in the average num-ber of fetuses with one or more sternebral variations per litterthat was observed in the 4% and 7.5% dietary groups was con-sidered a random occurrence. Thus, the ingestion of gum arabicdid not affect the incidence of litters with fetuses with sternebralvariations.\\nSkeletal ossiﬁcation deﬁciencies were observed in bones\\nother than sternebrae; however, no dose-related differences wereobserved between experimental and control groups with respectto any variation. Furthermore, no dose-related effect was foundon the incidence of variations, fetuses with variations, or littersaffected in any of the dietary groups.\\nAlso, no dose-related effect was observed on the incidence of\\nany type of soft-tissue variation. Most of the soft tissue variations\\ninvolved the kidneys. Additionally, the incidence of soft tissue\\nvariations in fetuses from experimental and control groups wassimilar. The mean numbers of soft tissue variations per litterranged from 0.30 (15% dietary group) to 0.82 (7.5% dietarygroup), and the mean was 0.76 per litter in the control group(Collins et al. 1987).Schardein et al. (1965) administered a 10% aqueous Acacia\\nsolution by gavage to two groups of nine Little Dutch strainmated female rabbits (average weight =2.1 kg) at doses of 1.26\\nand 1.5 ml/kg, respectively. Doses were administered on day 0and the following 6 days (7 doses per female). Nine untreated\\nrabbits served as negative controls. Blastocysts were removedfrom the uterine horns at 6.5 days of age, prepared as ﬂat mounts,\\nand then evaluated.\\nThe number of fertile rabbits with blastocysts recovered\\n(eight of nine rabbits) in the 1.26 and 1.5 ml/kg dose groupswas the same as that noted for the untreated control group. Themean numbers of blastocysts per rabbit were as follows: un-\\ntreated controls (5.3 ±1.2), 1.26 ml/kg dose group (7.0 ±1.7),\\nand 1.5 ml/kg dose group (5.4 ±2.2). Normal microscopic vari-\\nations in blastocysts were reported for test and control groups.These variations included minor trophoblastic vacuolation, tro-phoblastic degeneration granules, and trophoblastic knob for-mations (Schardein et al. 1965).\\nMorseth and Ihara (1989a) studied the teratogenicity of a\\n5% solution of gum arabic (powder) in distilled water using\\n36 female Crl: CDBR rats ( ∼9 months old) for which mating\\nhad been conﬁrmed. Body weights on gestation day 0 rangedfrom 207 to 314 g. The solution was administered by gavageonce daily (5 ml/kg/day) on gestation days 6 through 17. Thedams were necropsied on day 20 of gestation. Fetuses weresubjected to external (303 fetuses), visceral (102 fetuses), andskeletal (201 fetuses) examinations.\\nExternal variations were not observed in any of the fetuses\\nevaluated; however, external malformations, brachygnathia andrudimentary/short tail, were observed in one fetus. Visceral vari-ations included only two fetuses with increased renal pelviccavitation. At skeletal evaluation, one fetus had brachygnathia,tail short/rudimentary, abnormal fusion of sternebrae, and verte-bral anomaly with/without associated rib anomaly. The external,visceral, and skeletal malformations observed were unrelated todosing with Acacia (Morseth and Ihara 1989a).\\nMorseth and Ihara (1989b) evaluated the effect of a 5% so-\\nlution of gum arabic (powder) in distilled water on fertility andgeneral reproductive performance using 30 male (6 weeks old;\\nweights =181.9 to 226.3 g) and 30 female (10 weeks old;\\nweights =210.9 to 309.9 g) Sprague-Dawley Crl: CDBR rats.\\nThe solution was administered (oral intubation) to male and fe-male rats once daily (5 ml/kg/day) for 63 days prior to mating,throughout the mating period, and until the animals were killed.Male rats were killed after the females had littered. The oraldosing schedule for female rats was daily for 14 days prior tomating, throughout the mating period, and through gestation day19 or day 21 of lactation. Fifteen female rats were killed on day20 of gestation, and the remaining females were allowed to raisetheir neonates to day 22 postpartum.\\nNo abnormal estrous cycles that were considered treatment-\\nrelated were observed in any of the females. Twenty-nine of the30 females became pregnant; the male fertility index was 97%.Mean viability and mean weaning indices were 96% and 98%,108 COSMETIC INGREDIENT REVIEW\\nrespectively. No external, skeletal, or soft tissue malformations\\nwere observed (Morseth and Ihara 1989b).\\nThe reproductive toxicity of 5% Gum Acacia was evaluated\\nusing nine male Syrian golden hamsters (8 weeks old; weights =\\n80 to 100 g). The males were mated with female Syrian goldenhamsters in order to conﬁrm fertility. Subsequently, the maleswere dosed (oral gavage) with 5% Gum Acacia (dose volume =\\n0.1 ml/10 g body weight) daily for 54 days. The animals werekilled 3 days after the last dose. As determined by analysis oftestis sections, spermatogenesis was reported for all hamsters.All of the hamsters produced morphologically normal sperm,which were also observed in the epididymis (Waller et al. 1983).\\nYegnanarayan and Joglekar (1978) studied the antifertility\\neffects of 4% Gum Acacia in a series of ﬁve experiments using\\nmale and female rats and female rabbits of the Haffkine strain.\\nIn the ﬁrst study, six male albino rats (weights =175 to 225 g)\\nwere tested. The rats were dosed orally daily for 28 days usinga rubber catheter. Beginning on the ﬁrst day of feeding, maleswere mated (one male to two females) with females for 12 weeks.Females were replaced each week of feeding. Additional groupsof females were mated with control males dosed with salineaccording to the same procedure. V aginal smears were examineddaily for the presence of spermatozoa. Pregnant females weresurgically observed on the tenth day of pregnancy.\\nThe number of inseminated females (73) was the same in\\nexperimental and control groups. The total number of pregnantfemales in experimental and control groups was 24 and 37, re-spectively, but this difference was not statistically signiﬁcant.\\nIn the second experiment, the effect of 4% Gum Acacia on\\nthe estrus cycle and mating was evaluated using fertile female\\nalbino rats (weights =150 to 200 g). The experiment was di-\\nvided into two phases. In the ﬁrst phase (short-term treatment),4% Gum Acacia was administered orally to 10 female rats overa period of two estrus cycles, beginning on the day of proestrus.The females were mated singly with males during the proestrusphase of the third estrus cycle. In the second phase (long-termtreatment), 4% Gum Acacia was administered orally to six fe-male rats over a period of six estrus cycles, beginning in theproestrus phase. Mating was allowed in the proestrus stage ofthe seventh estrus cycle. In both the ﬁrst and second experimen-tal phases, control females dosed with saline were mated withmales according to the same procedures, respectively. Resultsfor the ﬁrst and second phases of this experiment indicated nosigniﬁcant differences in mating (number of females insemi-nated) between experimental and control groups. Additionally,for both phases, no signiﬁcant changes were observed in theduration of estrus cycles after dosing.\\nThe third experiment, for determining anti-implantation ef-\\nfects, involved 10 fertile rats (weight range from 150 to 200 g)that were mated in proestrus singly with fertile males. Femaleswere dosed orally with 4% gum arabic on days 1 to 7 of preg-nancy. The animals were allowed to deliver normally and littersizes were recorded. Ten control females dosed with saline weremated according to the same procedure. No statistically signif-icant differences were observed in average litter sizes between\\nexperimental and control groups, indicating that fetal resorptiondid not occur in litters of rats dosed with 4% gum arabic.\\nThe fourth experiment was performed to determine any\\npostimplantation effect of 4% gum arabic using ten fertile rats(weights =150 to 200 g). Female rats were dosed orally with 4%\\ngum arabic on days 10 to 16 and the number of pups deliveredwas determined. The rats were observed for vaginal bleeding,indicative of abortifacient activity during pregnancy. Control fe-males were dosed with saline according to the same procedure.One of 10 experimental rats did not have a litter. All controlfemales had litters. No statistically signiﬁcant differences wereobserved in the number of pups delivered between experimentaland control groups.\\nIn the ﬁfth experiment, the antiovulatory potential of 4% Gum\\nAcacia was evaluated using adult female rabbits (number notstated; weights =1 to 2 kg). The rabbits were dosed orally with\\n4% gum arabic for 2 days. Copper acetate (4 mg/kg) was theninjected into the marginal ear vein in order to induce ovulation.\\nAt 48 h post injection, laparotomy was performed; fresh bleed-\\ning points on the ovaries were indicative of ovulation. Controlrabbits were pretreated with saline according to the same proce-dure prior to the injection of copper acetate. After the injectionof copper acetate, bleeding points on the ovaries were observedin all control and experimental rabbits. Therefore, the authorsconcluded that 4% Gum Acacia did not have an inhibitory effecton ovulation (Yegnanarayan and Joglekar 1978).\\nA 1% aqueous suspension or mucilage prepared from gum\\narabic had no lethal effects on fetuses of NMRI mice injectedintraperitoneally (single injection or series of ﬁve injections),\\nsubcutaneously (ﬁve injections), or administered orally (ﬁvetimes) between the 11th and 15th day of gestation (Frohberget al. 1969).\\nThe embryotoxicity of 1% Gum Acacia was evaluated using\\nten Charles Foster rats (90 days old; weights =200±20 g). The\\ntest substance was administered daily at a dose of 50 mg/kg/dayduring the period of organogenesis. The fetuses were delivered\\nby cesarean section on day 20 of gestation, ﬁxed in Bouin’ssolution, and examined for visceral and skeletal defects. None\\nof the fetuses had gross or visceral defects (Sethi et al. 1989).\\nCLINICAL ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY\\nAbsorption, Distribution, and Excretion\\nGum Arabic\\nThe FASEB (1973) review stated that there was no evidence\\nof the absorption of intact gum arabic found in a study usinginfants. Twenty-two infants, 1 to 15 months old, were fed gumarabic (15 to 20 g per day) in milk. No urinary excretion ofpentose or signiﬁcant excretion of gum arabic was observed inthe stools.\\nIn a nephrotic patient, 20% of the gum arabic injected intra-\\nvenously over a period of 6 weeks was excreted in the urine.ACACIA 109\\nOther studies involving patients with nephrosis indicated that\\nintravenously injected Gum Acacia, or some product associatedwith it, accumulated in the liver and remained in the tissuesfor several months. Serious disturbances in hemoglobin, whiteblood cells, and serum proteins, all nonlethal effects, were noted(FASEB 1973).\\nRoss et al. (1984a) evaluated the excretion of gum arabic and\\nits effect on glucose absorption and routine hematological andbiochemical measurements in ﬁve healthy male volunteers (30 to55 years old). All subjects were free of signs of gastrointestinaldisease. The study was divided into two time periods, a 7-daycontrol period that was followed by a 24-day treatment period.After an overnight fast, glucose (50 g in 200 ml H\\n20) was fed to\\neach subject on the ﬁrst day of the control period. During the 24-day treatment period, gum arabic (25 g in 125 ml 7% dextrose)was ingested daily by each subject. Urine was collected on 1 dayof the control period and on 1 day during the 3rd week of thetreatment period. Complete 5-day fecal collections were madeon days 2 to 6 of the control period and on days 16 to 20 ofthe treatment period. Pooled stool slurry samples from the ﬁvesubjects were centrifuged. A precipitate typical of gum arabicwas not detected in fecal specimens collected before or after theadministration of gum arabic.\\nThe marked increases in breath hydrogen production noted\\nafter gum arabic ingestion were indicative of bacterial break-down of gum arabic in the cecum and colon after 3 weeks ofadministration. Additional study results are summarized in the\\nfollowing paragraph.\\nNo signiﬁcant differences in the mean concentration of serum\\nlipids (phospholipids and triglycerides) were noted before andafter gum arabic ingestion. However, a signiﬁcant decrease inserum cholesterol (0.39 mmol/L reduction; p<.05) was noted.\\nAlso, no statistically signiﬁcant differences were observed be-tween the mean blood glucose concentration (control) and theglucose concentration after the administration of gum arabic.\\nSimilarly, no signiﬁcant differences were found in the mean\\ninsulin concentration (before versus after gum arabic ingestion).\\nAlanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activ-ities were signiﬁcantly reduced ( p<.0025; p<.001) after\\ngum arabic ingestion; however, both mean values were withinthe normal limits for the population. Of the 13 biochemical mea-surements that were estimated in the plasma, these reductionsin plasma enzyme concentrations represented the only notedsigniﬁcant changes (Ross et al. 1984a).\\nShort-Term Oral Toxicity\\nGum Arabic\\nFive healthy male subjects (30 to 55 years old) ingested 25 g\\ngum arabic (Acacia Senegal Gum) daily for 21 days. Toxic ef-fects were not observed during the 21-day period; breath hydro-gen concentrations increased only after chronic administration.The fact that gum arabic was not recovered from the feces sug-gest that it is degraded extensively in the human colon (Anderson\\n1986).Short-Term Intravenous Toxicity\\nAcacia (Not Gum Arabic)\\nAcacia was administered to nine patients with nephrotic\\nedema over periods up to 8 weeks. The test substance was admin-istered intravenously, and total doses ranged from 80 to 325 g.No signs or symptoms of hepatic enlargement or any other com-plications were observed. Five of the patients excreted 5.5% to38% of a single dose in the urine during periods ranging from10 to 30 days, respectively (World Health Organization 1974).\\nSkin Irritation\\nAcacia (Not Gum Arabic)\\nThe skin irritation potential of Acacia Farnesiana Extract\\n(from ﬂowers, 4.0% in petrolatum) was evaluated in a 48-hclosed-patch test using 30 healthy male and female volunteers.Skin irritation was not observed (Letizia et al. 2000).\\nShaligram and V akil (1990) evaluated the skin irritation po-\\ntential of Acacia Concinna Fruit Extract (2% in carageenan base[pH of 6 to 7] or 2% in a shampoo [pH of 7 to 8]) in a usetest involving 30 normal subjects. The carageenan base and theshampoo, both without the fruit extract, served as controls. Theapplication procedure was described as a routine half head (wetsurface) application of Acacia Concinna Fruit Extract (in car-rageenan base or in shampoo). The respective controls wereapplied to the other half of the head (wet surface). Applicationof test and control materials was followed by rinsing with warmwater at 10 to 15 min post exposure. The scalp of each subjectwas evaluated for signs of irritation (erythema, edema, or anyother reaction) at 24 and 48 h post application.\\nNeither Acacia Concinna Fruit Extract (2% in carrageenan\\nor 2% in shampoo base) nor the controls induced skin irritation(Shaligram and V akil 1990).\\nSkin Sensitization\\nGum Arabic\\nIvy Laboratories (2000) evaluated the skin sensitization po-\\ntential of a mascara containing 8.0% Acacia Senegal in a max-imization test using 28 healthy adult volunteers (males andfemales, 18 to 49 years old). Twenty-ﬁve subjects completed thestudy because three withdrew for reasons that were unrelated tothe test procedure. During the induction phase, approximately0.1 ml of 0.25% aqueous sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) was ap-plied (under an occlusive patch) to each subject. Patches wereapplied to the upper outer arm, volar forearm, or to the back for\\n24 h. After patch removal, 0.1 ml of the mascara was applied (un-\\nder an occlusive patch) to the same site on each subject. Patchesremained in place for 48 h, except for weekend applications inwhich the contact period was 72 h. Sites were observed for signsof irritation at the time of patch removal.\\nIf skin irritation was not observed, an occlusive patch con-\\ntaining 0.25% aqueous SLS was applied to the same test site for24 h. An occlusive patch containing the test substance was then\\napplied to the same site for 48 h.

Priorto challenge patch application, a new site on the opposite arm,forearm, or side of the back was pretreated for 1 h with 5%aqueous SLS (0.1 ml under occlusive patch). A single challengepatch (occlusive patch) was then applied to the same site for48 h. Reactions were scored at 1 and 24 h after patch removalaccording to the following scale: 0 (not sensitized) to 3 (strongsensitization [large vesiculobullous reaction]).\\nSensitization reactions were not observed at 1 or 24 h after\\nchallenge patch removal. It was concluded that, under the con-ditions of this test, the mascara containing 8.0% Acacia Senegaldid not possess a detectable contact-sensitizing potential, and,\\nhence, is not likely to cause contact sensitivity reactions under\\nnormal use conditions (Ivy Laboratories 2000).\\nAcacia (Not Gum Arabic)\\nLetizia et al. (2000) evaluated the sensitization potential of\\nAcacia Farnesiana Extract (from ﬂowers, 4% in petrolatum) in amaximization test using 30 healthy male and female volunteers.The test substance was applied, under occlusion, to the samesite on both forearms of each subject throughout induction. Theinduction phase consisted of a total of ﬁve 48-h exposures (onalternate days).\\nPrior to application of the initial induction patch, the test\\nsite was pretreated with 5% aqueous SLS, under occlusion. Theinduction phase was followed by a 14-day nontreatment period,after which a challenge patch was applied (48 h) to new siteson each subject. Challenge patch applications were preceded by30 min applications of 2% aqueous SLS, under occlusion, on theleft side. Challenge sites on the right side were not pretreated.A ﬁfth challenge site (petrolatum applied) served as the control.\\nIt was concluded that none of the reactions observed could\\nbe classiﬁed as a signiﬁcant skin irritation or allergic reaction(Letizia et al. 2000).\\nCase Reports\\nGum Arabic\\nGelfand (1949) reported allergic disorders in 10 subjects\\n(7 males, 3 females; 11 to 55 years old) who had ingested variousgum-containing foods. Gum arabic was among the gums presentin each food ingested. Some of the allergic symptoms reportedincluded bronchial asthma, generalized urticaria, and vasomo-tor rhinitis. Allergic symptoms were not observed upon removalof suspect gum-containing foods from the diet, and symptomswere reproduced when clinical trials were repeated.\\nPositive skin reactions (test procedure not stated) to gum ara-\\nbic were observed in each of the 10 subjects. The results ofserologic studies (sera from four subjects) indicated that gumarabic was the dominant gum antigen in two subjects and thattragacanth and karaya were the dominant gum antigens in theremaining two subjects. The serological studies included pas-sive transfer tests in serial dilutions and neutralization studies.It was determined that gum arabic and other vegetable gums\\ncould cause allergic disorders by ingestion in sensitive subjects(Gelfand 1949).\\nRaghuprasad et al. (1980) reported cross-reactivity between\\nGum Acacia and gum tragacanth in a 24-year-old patient who de-veloped sensitization to Quillaja bark ( Quillaja saponaria ) dust,\\nwhich resulted in rhinitis and asthma. The CIR Expert Panel haspreviously evaluated the safety of Tragacanth Gum in cosmetics,and concluded that this ingredient is safe in the present practicesof use and concentration (Elder 1987). Speciﬁc immunoglobu-lin E(IgE) to pulverized Quillaja bark, gum arabic, and gumtragacanth were measured according to a modiﬁcation of theradioallergosorbent test (RAST). Each of the three antigens (20mg/ml) was coupled directly to methyl cellulose disks that hadbeen activated previously by cyanogen bromide dissolved inacetonitrile. Results were expressed as percent binding.\\nThe amount of radioactivity bound by the patient’s serum was\\ncompared with control sera from healthy, nonallergic volunteers(number not stated) not known to be exposed to Quillaja bark\\ndust. The mean percent binding of IgE to Quillaja bark in patient\\nsera was 22.4%, compared to 3.2% for the control. Comparedto negligible binding in control sera, signiﬁcant binding wasreported for gum arabic (32.5% binding) and gum tragacanth(30.8% binding) (Raghuprasad et al. 1980).\\nAdditional case reports on gum arabic and other species of\\nAcacia are summarized in Table 12. Although two fatalities are\\nreported, neither related to gum arabic and most case reportsinvolve sensitization reactions.\\nSUMMARY\\nThis safety assessment includes the following ingredients, de-\\nrived from Acacia, that are listed in the International Cosmetic\\nIngredient Dictionary and Handbook : Acacia Catechu Gum,\\nAcacia Concinna Fruit Extract, Acacia Dealbata Leaf Extract,Acacia Dealbata Leaf Wax, Acacia Decurrens Extract, AcaciaFarnesiana Extract, Acacia Farnesiana Flower Wax, Acacia Far-nesiana Gum, Acacia Senegal Extract, Acacia Senegal Gum, andAcacia Senegal Gum Extract.\\nGum arabic is another name for Acacia Senegal Gum. Gum\\narabic is generally recognized as safe for direct addition to foodfor human ingestion. Acacia Senegal Gum has been describedas the major commercial Acacia gum. Gum arabic is producedwhen the Acacia tree is stressed by infection, poor nutrition,heat, or lack of moisture. The gum exudes through wounds inthe bark that occur naturally or are purposely made to stimulate\\nproduction.\\nGum arabic is composed of\\nD-galactose, L-rhamnose, L-\\narabinose, and D-glucuronic acid residues in an arrangement of\\na main chain of galactosyl units joined by β-D-(1→3) linkages\\nand side chains or branched oligosaccharides linked to the mainchain by β-\\nD-(1→6) linkages. It has also been described as a\\ncomplex mixture of calcium, magnesium, and potassium salts\\nof arabic acid. Arabic acid is a complex of galactose, rhamnose,\\narabinose, and glucuronic acid.ACACIA 113\\nAﬂatoxin has been reported as an impurity in Acacia Catechu,\\nbut not in gum arabic. Acacia Gum (Acacia Senegal) did notcontain detectable pesticide residues.\\nQualitative information is available on the components that\\nmay be found in ingredients derived from various Acacia speciesand plant parts. This information indicates a few similarities andmany differences in constituents. Quantitative or semiquantita-tive data were not available.\\nThe principal UV absorbance of gum arabic occurred at wave-\\nlengths below 240 nm. At wavelengths above 240 nm, the UVabsorbance was not signiﬁcant.\\nAcacia Decurrens Extract and Acacia Farnesiana Extract\\nare described as a cosmetic astringent, and Acacia Decurrensis also described as a skin-conditioning agent—occlusive, al-\\nthough none of these are reported to be in current use. Cosmeticfunctions of the other Acacia-derived ingredients included inthis review are not described. Product formulation data submit-ted to the FDA indicated that Acacia was used in 22 cosmetic\\nproducts—no information is available to further describe thespecies or plant part. Cosmetic use concentration data suppliedby the cosmetics industry indicated maximum use concentra-tions of 9% in shampoos for Acacia Senegal Gum and 0.001%\\nfor Acacia Senegal Gum Extract, in bath soaps and detergents.\\nRecommended use concentrations of Acacia Concinna Fruit\\nExtract are 1.0% to 2.0% for use in shampoos, hair packs, hairconditioners, and hair rinses, although no uses have been re-ported to FDA.\\nThe weight gain for rats fed gum arabic at a dietary con-\\ncentration of 16% was 75% of that reported for control rats.Approximately 80% of the gum arabic was absorbed. Resultsfrom other studies involving rats suggest that the metabolism ofgum arabic is mediated by bacteria in the cecum.\\nResults of studies in which dogs and rabbits were injected\\nintravenously with gum arabic indicated that gum arabic or someother product associated with it accumulated in the liver andremained in the tissues for several months. Nonlethal effectsincluded disturbances in hemoglobin values, white blood cells,and serum proteins.\\nBased on absorption and metabolism studies an expert anal-\\nysis determined that gum arabic is capable of being digested to\\nsimple sugars. It was also determined that conclusive evidenceindicating that the intact gum arabic molecule is absorbed under\\nnormal conditions was lacking.\\nIn an in vitro assay, dose-dependent uncoupling of oxidative\\nphosphorylation was noted in groups of rats dosed orally withgum arabic up to 10% twice daily for 4 weeks, but comparablebiochemical effects were not observed in vivo.\\nAn acute oral LD\\n50of 8000 mg/kg was reported for Acacia\\nGum in rabbits. The acute oral LD 50for Acacia Farnesiana Ex-\\ntract (from ﬂowers) in rabbits was >5.0 g/kg. A minimal lethal\\ndose of >2 g/kg (10 ml/kg) for Acacia Dealbata Leaf Wax in a\\nsuspension with parafﬁn oil was reported in an acute oral tox-icity study involving rats. None of the animals died, and no\\ntest substance-related lesions of organs examined were noted atnecropsy. Similarly, in another study, no deaths or test substance-\\nrelated, organ lesions were reported following the oral adminis-tration of Acacia Farnesiana Flower Wax at a dose of 10 ml/kg.\\nIn an acute dermal toxicity study of Acacia Farnesiana Extract\\n(from ﬂowers) involving rabbits, an LD\\n50of>5.0 g/kg was\\nreported.\\nGum arabic did not cause any abnormal changes in serum\\nchemistry parameters or induce toxicologically signiﬁcant le-sions in rats that received oral doses daily for 28 days. Gum ara-bic was also administered to rats in four other short-term oral tox-icity studies. Collectively, test concentrations ranged from 1%to 20% and study durations ranged from 28 days to 9 weeks. No\\nsigniﬁcant or discernible ultrastructural differences were foundbetween tissues (heart, liver, small intestine) of control rats and\\ntest rats; hematological ﬁndings were normal. Gum arabic wasnontoxic, even at the highest concentration tested.\\nOne of three dogs injected intravenously (32 to 35 injections)\\nwith gum arabic over a period of 76 days died. The range for thetotal cumulative dose was 15.7 to 47.7 g/kg, and death occurred\\nat the highest dose (47.7 g/kg). An enlarged liver was observed in\\nthe animal that died, and the cause of death was not determined.Enlarged livers and swollen kidneys were also observed in dogsthat received doses ranging from 1 to 2 g/kg.\\nIn a subchronic (13 weeks) oral toxicity study on Acacia\\nSenegal Gum, the only treatment-related alteration noted in ratsat necropsy was cecal enlargement in animals of the highest dose(14 g/kg/day) groups.\\nElectron microscopic ﬁndings for samples of livers and kid-\\nneys from groups of ﬁve rats fed diets containing 0.5% to 3.5%w/w Acacia Senegal Gum daily for 91 days were negative. Mito-\\nchondria and nuclei were ultrastructurally normal in appearanceand internal structure.\\nThe administration of a single dermal dose of Acacia Farne-\\nsiana Extract (from ﬂowers, 5.0 g/kg) to rabbits induced moder-ate erythema and edema. Undiluted Acacia Dealbata Leaf Waxwas classiﬁed as a non-irritant after application, under occlusivepatches, to scariﬁed skin of albino rabbits for 24 h. UndilutedAcacia Farnesiana Flower Wax was classiﬁed as a slight irritant\\nwhen tested according to a similar procedure.\\nA 20.0% solution of Acacia Farnesiana Extract in methanol\\n(from ﬂowers) did not induce phototoxicity in SKH:hairlessmice.\\nAnaphylactic signs in guinea pigs injected intraperitoneally\\n(mild challenge reactions) or intravenously (strong challenge re-actions) with Acacia solution have been reported. No signs ofanaphylaxis were observed in rabbits injected intravenously (nochallenge reaction) with Acacia solution. In rabbits and guineapigs injected with 7% Gum Acacia solution, no deleterious ef-fects on antibody production resulted.\\nMouse footpad swelling test results indicated a signiﬁcant\\nincrease in footpad thickness (compared to controls) in miceimmunized by injection of gum arabic in saline and Freund’s ad-juvant. Antigen-speciﬁc hypersensitivity reactions were noted.In a similar test, footpad swelling was signiﬁcantly suppressed114 COSMETIC INGREDIENT REVIEW\\n(compared to controls) in mice dosed orally with gum arabic\\nand then immunized by injection of gum arabic in saline andFreund’s adjuvant. In another test, intradermal challenge afterimmunization of mice with Acacia Senegal Gum caused a sig-niﬁcant increase in footpad thickness.\\nGum arabic was not mutagenic in numerous in vitro mu-\\ntagenicity tests using Salmonella typhimurium, Saccharomyces\\ncerevisiae, and Bacillus subtilis bacterial strains. In an in vitro\\ncytogenetics assay, though results were classiﬁed as slightly pos-itive, gum arabic did not induce deﬁnite abnormal anaphase ﬁg-ures in diploid human embryonic lung (WI-38) ﬁbroblasts. Themutagenicity of gum arabic was also evaluated in numerous invivo assays, the results of which were mostly negative.\\nStatistically signiﬁcant positive results were noted in one of\\nthe three dominant lethal tests (rat assay, but not in two mouseassays) that were performed. Further testing in the mouse her-itable translocation test yielded negative results. In acute andshort-term in vivo cytogenetics assays (rats), though no signif-icant positive responses were observed, there may have beena slight positive response. It was stated that further tests anda detailed statistical evaluation are needed in order to conﬁrm\\nthis possibility. There were no statistically signiﬁcant ﬁndings\\nin mouse chromosomal aberrations and sperm-head morphol-ogy assays. Negative results were also reported in micronucleustests (mouse bone marrow smears) and other in vivo assays.\\nNo evidence of carcinogenicity was observed in rats dosed\\nintraperitoneally with gum arabic (1.75% or 7.0% in saline orwater) three times per week for up to 15 weeks. In another study,tumors were not observed in guinea pigs injected intramediasti-nally with 0.1 ml of a gruel of gum arabic (single dose).\\nThe carcinogenicity of gum arabic was also evaluated using\\n4-week-old F344 and 4- to 5-week-old B6C3F\\n1mice. Low-dose\\nanimals were fed gum arabic at a concentration of 25 g/kg inthe diet and high-dose animals were fed 50 g/kg for 103 weeks.Neoplasms were observed only in male rats, and were diagnosedas malignant lymphomas or leukemia-lymphoma. Compared tocontrols, no signiﬁcant increases were observed in the incidenceof either type of neoplasm at either of the two test concentrations;gum arabic was classiﬁed as noncarcinogenic in rats and mice.\\nOral administration of gum arabic (1 ml) did not cause antifer-\\ntility effects in female rats or the suppression of spermatogenesisin male rats. Gum arabic was not teratogenic when administeredorally to mice at doses up to 1600 mg/kg. Oral doses of gumarabic up to 1600 mg/kg also were not teratogenic in rats andhamsters, and oral doses up to 800 mg/kg were not teratogenic\\nin rabbits.\\nNo effects on fertility or ovulation (4% gum arabic), or any\\nabnormal variations in blastocysts (10% gum arabic) were foundin rabbits. Gum arabic, at a concentration of 15%, failed to in-duce teratogenicity or other reproductive effects in female rats.Gum arabic (5%) also did not cause abnormal sperm develop-ment in hamsters. Embryotoxicity was not noted in mice injectedintraperitoneally with a 1% aqueous suspension or mucilage pre-\\npared from gum arabic.No evidence of absorption of intact gum arabic was found in\\n22 infants fed gum arabic in milk. In a patient with nephrosis,20% of the gum arabic injected intravenously was excreted inthe urine over a period of 6 weeks. Gum arabic was not detectedin feces specimens collected from ﬁve male volunteers beforeor after administration of the gum.\\nToxic effects were not observed in ﬁve male subjects who\\ningested 25 g of gum arabic daily for 21 days.\\nIn a 48-h closed patch test, Acacia Farnesiana Extract (from\\nﬂowers, 4.0% in petrolatum) did not induce skin irritation inany of the 30 subjects tested. In an “in-use test,” skin irritation\\nwas not observed in any of the 30 subjects tested with AcaciaConcinna Fruit Extract (2% in natural base [such as carageenan]and a routine shampoo base). The test substance remained incontact with the scalp for 10 to 15 min, and skin irritation wasevaluated immediately after application and 24 and 48 h later.\\nThe skin sensitization potential of a mascara containing 8.0%\\nAcacia Senegal was evaluated in the maximization test using 28healthy adult volunteers. It was concluded that, under the con-\\nditions of this test, the mascara containing 8.0% Acacia Senegaldid not possess a detectable contact-sensitizing potential, and,hence, is not likely to cause contact sensitivity reactions undernormal use conditions.\\nThe results of a study involving ten subjects who had ingested\\nvarious gum-containing foods, indicated that gum arabic couldcause allergic disorders in sensitive subjects. Analyses of serafrom 4 of the 10 subjects indicated that gum arabic was thedominant gum antigen in two subjects. Cross-reactivity betweengum arabic and gum tragacanth was reported for a 24-year-oldpatient who developed sensitization to Quillaja bark ( Quillaja\\nsaponaria ) dust, which led to rhinitis and asthma.\\nNeither signiﬁcant skin irritation nor allergic reactions to 4%\\nAcacia Farnesiana Extract (from ﬂowers) in petrolatum wereobserved in a maximization test (30 subjects).\\nA number of case reports of gum arabic allergenicity have\\nbeen identiﬁed in the published literature.\\nDISCUSSION\\nExtensive safety test data are available on gum arabic that\\ndemonstrate its safety in a wide variety of applications, includ-ing cosmetic use. Based on the available information, the Panelconcluded that Acacia Senegal Gum is equivalent to gum arabic\\nand should be considered safe as used in cosmetics. It also ap-\\npears that gums from other species are not the same as AcaciaSenegal Gum. It follows that the safety test data on gum arabiccan be used to support the safety of Acacia Senegal Gum andnot gum from other Acacia species. Because Acacia SenegalGum Extract is derived from Acacia Senegal Gum, the Panelconsidered that Acacia Senegal Gum Extract would present noadditional safety issues.\\nThe Panel recognized the potential for allergic responses to\\ngum arabic. However, because of negative results for all 25 sub-jects in a human maximization study (mascara containing 8%ACACIA 115\\nAcacia Senegal) and the expected slow rate of dermal absorption\\nof gum arabic due to its large molecular size and water solubil-ity, the Panel determined that it is not likely that normal use ofgum arabic in a cosmetic product would result in sensitization.\\nThe Panel is concerned that the available data suggesting the\\nabsence of pesticide residues in Acacia plants harvested wild arelimited. The Panel advised the industry that the total polychlo-rinated biphenyl (PCB)/pesticide contamination of any plant-derived cosmetic ingredient should be limited to not more than40 ppm, with not more than 10 ppm for any speciﬁc residue. ThePanel also advised that limits were appropriate for the followingimpurities: arsenic (3 mg/kg maximum), heavy metals (0.002%maximum), and lead (5 mg/kg maximum).\\nThe limited safety test data on Acacia Farnesiana Extract and\\non Acacia Concinna Fruit Extract were not sufﬁcient to assessthe safety of these ingredients in cosmetics.\\nThe Panel found no information that adequately character-\\nized the composition of fruit, leaf or other extracts, leaf wax,ﬂower wax, or gum from Acacia species other than A. senegal .\\nTherefore, the Panel could not extrapolate the available dataon gum arabic to support the safety of Acacia Catechu Gum,Acacia Concinna Fruit Extract, Acacia Dealbata Leaf Extract,\\nAcacia Dealbata Leaf Wax, Acacia Decurrens Extract, AcaciaFarnesiana Extract, Acacia Farnesiana Flower Wax, Acacia Far-\\nnesiana Gum, and Acacia Senegal Extract. The Panel concludedthat available data are insufﬁcient to support the safety of theseAcacia-derived ingredients.\\nThe additional data needed for these ingredients include\\n1. concentration of use in cosmetics;\\n2. identify the chemical composition; if they are sufﬁciently dif-\\nferent from those of Acacia Senegal Gum, then the followingdata would be needed:\\na. UV absorption spectrum; if there is signiﬁcant absorbance\\nin the UV A or UVB range, then phototoxicity and photo-sensitization studies may be needed;\\nb. with the exception of Acacia Farnesiana Extract and Aca-\\ncia Concinna Fruit Extract, sensitization and irritation dataare needed;\\nc. two genotoxicity assays, one in a mammalian system; if\\npositive, then a 2-year dermal carcinogenicity study us-ing National Toxicology Program (NTP) methods may beneeded;\\nd. dermal absorption data; if there is any evidence of signif-\\nicant dermal absorption, then reproductive and develop-\\nmental toxicity data may be needed.\\nCONCLUSION\\nBased on the available animal and clinical data included in\\nthis report, the CIR Expert Panel concluded that Acacia SenegalGum and Acacia Senegal Gum Extract are safe as used in cos-metic products. The Panel also concluded that the available dataare insufﬁcient to support the safety of the following ingredientsin cosmetic products: Acacia Catechu Gum, Acacia ConcinnaFruit Extract, Acacia Dealbata Leaf Extract, Acacia Dealbata\\nLeaf Wax, Acacia Decurrens Extract, Acacia Farnesiana Ex-tract, Acacia Farnesiana Flower Wax, Acacia Farnesiana Gum,and Acacia Senegal Extract.\\nREFERENCES\\nAbdalla, M.

The Panelreviewed relevant data relating to the safety of these ingredients, and concluded that these carbonate salts are safe in the present\\npractices of use and concentration in cosmetics when formulated to be non-irritating.\\nIntroduction\\nThe safety of the following 6 carbonate salts as used in\\ncosmetics is reviewed in this safety assessment:\\nMagnesium Carbonate\\nAmmonium Bicarbonate\\nAmmonium Carbonate\\nCalcium CarbonatePotassium BicarbonatePotassium Carbonate\\nAccording to the International Cosmetic Ingredient Dic-\\ntionary and Handbook (Dictionary ), the functions of these\\ningredients in cosmetic products include: absorbents, bulking\\nagents, opacifying agents, pH adjusters, buffering agents,\\nabrasives, and oral care agents (Table 1).\\n1Ingredient de ﬁni-\\ntions are also included in Table 1.\\nThe Expert Panel for Cosmetic Ingredient Safety (Panel)\\nhas evaluated the safety of Sodium Sesquicarbonate, SodiumBicarbonate, and Sodium Carbonate in cosmetic products, andconcluded that these ingredients are “safe as presently used in\\ncosmetics. ”\\n2Aﬁnal report with this conclusion was published\\nin 1987. Subsequently, during a Panel re-review of the safety\\nof these ingredients in 2004, the conclusion\"]\n",

The Panelreviewed relevant data relating to the safety of these ingredients, and concluded that these carbonate salts are safe in the present\\npractices of use and concentration in cosmetics when formulated to be non-irritating.\\nIntroduction\\nThe safety of the following 6 carbonate salts as used in\\ncosmetics is reviewed in this safety assessment:\\nMagnesium Carbonate\\nAmmonium Bicarbonate\\nAmmonium Carbonate\\nCalcium CarbonatePotassium BicarbonatePotassium Carbonate\\nAccording to the International Cosmetic Ingredient Dic-\\ntionary and Handbook (Dictionary ), the functions of these\\ningredients in cosmetic products include: absorbents, bulking\\nagents, opacifying agents, pH adjusters, buffering agents,\\nabrasives, and oral care agents (Table 1).\\n1Ingredient de ﬁni-\\ntions are also included in Table 1.\\nThe Expert Panel for Cosmetic Ingredient Safety (Panel)\\nhas evaluated the safety of Sodium Sesquicarbonate, SodiumBicarbonate, and Sodium Carbonate in cosmetic products, andconcluded that these ingredients are “safe as presently used in\\ncosmetics.\"]\n",
