The Panel reviewed relevantdata provided in this safety assessment, and concluded that these ingredients are safe in the present practices of use and\nconcentration.\nKeywords\nsafety, cosmetics, derivatives\nIntroduction\nMilk and dairy products, espec ially bovine (cow) sourced,\nare considered vital sources of nutrition for billions ofpeople around the world.\n1Milk proteins and protein de-\nrivatives form a broad category of materials that are pre-pared by extraction from bovin e milk and partial hydrolysis\nto yield cosmetic ingredients. The Food and Drug Ad-ministration (FDA) de ﬁnes the term “protein ”to mean any\nα-amino acid polymer with a speci ﬁcd eﬁned sequence that\nis greater than 40 amino acids in size.\n2The bovine milk\nproteins and protein derivativ es detailed in this report are\ndescribed by the International Cosmetic Ingredient Dic-\ntionary and Handbook (Dictionary )t of u n c t i o nm a i n l ya s\nskin and hair conditioning agents in personal care prod-ucts.\n3This report assesses the safety of the following 16\nmilk-derived ingredients:\nAmmonium Caseinate Hydrolyzed Yogurt Protein\nCalcium Caseinate LactoglobulinCasein Milk ProteinCasein Extract Milk Protein ExtractHydrolyzed Casein Potassium CaseinateHydrolyzed Lactalbumin Sodium Caseinate\nHydrolyzed Milk Protein Sodium Hydrolyzed Casein\nHydrolyzed Whey Protein Whey Protein\nThe safety of various hydrolyzed proteins as used in\ncosmetics has been reviewed by the Panel in several previousassessments. The Panel concluded that Hydrolyzed Keratin(ﬁnalized in 2016), Hydrolyzed Collagen (published in\n1985, re-review published in 2006) Hydrolyzed Soy Protein(ﬁnalized in 2015), Hydrolyzed Silk ( ﬁnalized in 2015),\nHydrolyzed Rice Protein (published in 2006), and HydrolyzedCorn Protein (published in 2011) are safe for use in cos-metics.\n4-10Additionally, the Panel concluded that Hydrolyzed\nWheat Gluten and Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein are safe for usein cosmetics when formulated to restrict peptides to a weight-average molecular weight (MW) of 3500 Daltons (Da) or\nless.\n11The Panel concurrently reviewed the safety of plant-\nderived proteins and peptides and tissue-derived proteins andpeptides, in separate reports.\nWhile relevant data on the cosmetic ingredient Hydrolyzed\nLactalbumin could not be identi ﬁed in the published literature,\ninformation on the unprocessed protein, lactalbumin, wasdiscovered and has been incorporated into this report to aid inthe review of safety.\nThis safety assessment includes relevant published and\nunpublished data that are available for each endpoint that isevaluated. Published data are identi ﬁed by conducting an\nexhaustive search of the world ’s literature.

Bovine milk proteins aresynthesized in the mammary epithelial cells and are onlyproduced by the mammary gland.\n12There are numerous milk\nproteins, but the most prevalent are caseins ( ∼79% of all milkproteins; the gelatinous material of the curd), and whey; whey\nis primarily lactalbumin ( ∼4%) and lactoglobulin ( ∼10%).13\nWhile other proteins exist in milk (e.g., enzymes, antibodies,\nand growth factors; all together comprising the other ∼7%),\nthe ingredients in this report predominantly comprise casein,lactalbumin, and/or lactoglobulin proteins.\nProtein hydrolysates can be prepared via acid hydrolysis,\nenzymatic hydrolysis, or other methodologies. The method-\nology selected and the conditions and duration of the hy-drolysis may profoundly affect the size and reactivity of thehydrolysates. Most of the ingredients in this report, even thosewithout “hydrolyzed ”in the name, are hydrolyzed to some\ndegree as necessary for extraction or solubilization. Furthersteps towards solubilization of these macromolecules com-monly include reaction with an alkaline substance to produce a\nprotein salt (e.g., Calcium Caseinate).Table 1.

Casein is described as an off-white\nto cream-colored granular or ﬁne powder. It is insoluble in\nwater and alcohol, but can be dissolved by aqueous alkalis toform caseinate salts.\n15Caseinate salts are white to cream-\ncolored granules or powders that are soluble or dispersible in\nwater. The amino acid sequence of β-casein contains 209\nresidues with an approximate MW of 23 600 Da.16\nHydrolyzed Casein. A supplier has reported that the MW of a\nHydrolyzed Casein product is approximately 600 Da.17\nHydrolyzed Milk Protein. A Hydrolyzed Milk Protein product\nwas described as a cream colored powder with a slight,\ncharacteristic odor and a pH of 5.0 to 7.0.18\nA supplier has reported that the MW of Hydrolyzed Milk\nProtein is ∼1000 Da.19Another supplier has reported the MW\ndistribution of 3 batches of Hydrolyzed Milk Protein yielded58.4% of the MW to be below 5000 Da and 41.4% of the MWto be greater than 5000 Da and less than 30 000 Da.\n20\nAt 25°C, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein is soluble in water,\npartially soluble in 75/25 and 50/50 water/ethanol, and in-\nsoluble in 25/75 water/ethanol, 200 proof ethanol, mineral oil,\nglycerin, and propylene glycol.18\nHydrolyzed Lactalbumin. α-Lactalbumin (non-hydrolyzed) is\ndescribed as a homogenous, free- ﬂowing, semi-hygroscopic,\nlight cream-colored powder.15Physical and chemical prop-\nerties on Hydrolyzed Lactalbumin were not found.\nMethod of Manufacturing\nMethods used to manufacture protein hydrolysates typicallyyield broad MW distributions of peptides, ranging from 500 to30 000 Da.\n21However, certain enzymes, such as papain, can\nroutinely produce narrower distributions of 500 to 10 000 Da.For example, if the average MW of an amino acid is 135 Da,then, under the broader distribution ﬁgures (i.e., 500 to\n30 000 Da), these ingredients are approximately 4 to 220\namino acids in length (and approximately 4 to 74 amino acidsin length under the narrower distribution, i.e., 500 to10 000 Da).\n22\nCasein. Commercial casein is derived from the coagulum\nformed by treating skim milk with a food-grade acid (acidcasein), enzyme (rennet casein), or other food-grade precip-\nitating agent.\n15After precipitation, Casein is separated fromthe soluble milk fraction, washed, and dried. Casein is a\nmixture of at least 20 electrophoretically distinct phospho-proteins, with the main fractions being α-casein, β-casein, and\nκ-casein.\nHydrolyzed Casein. A supplier reported that a Hydrolyzed\nCasein product (MW = 600 Da; 30% solution in water) isprepared by acidic, alkaline, and/or enzymatic hydrolysis of\nbovine milk until the MW reached the target range.\n17\nHydrolyzed Lactalbumin. α-Lactalbumin (non-hydrolyzed) is\nisolated from either bovine milk or from whey.15A method of\nmanufacture for the hydrolysis of lactalbumin (speci ﬁcally) to\nHydrolyzed Lactalbumin was not found.\nHydrolyzed Milk Protein. A supplier reported that Hydrolyzed\nMilk Protein is produced from milk intended for human\nconsumption.23The milk solids are separated and hydrolyzed\nwith a protease for 2 h. When the target MW is achieved, theenzyme is inactivated by heating the solution to 140°C for 30min. The inactivation step is repeated if gelatin mixed with asample loses viscosity, indicating the presence of activeprotease.\nAnother supplier reported that Hydrolyzed Milk Protein is\nmanufactured by enzymatic hydrolysis for a speci ﬁc duration\nand at an elevated temperature (details not provided).\n24The\nresultant hydrolyzed proteins have MWs in the 2000 -4000 Da range and all contain di- and tri-peptides.\nWhey Protein. Whey is the liquid obtained by separating the\ncoagulum from milk, cream, and/or skim milk (usually incheese making).\n15Acid-type whey is produced by converting\na signi ﬁcant amount of lactose to lactic acid or by directTable 2.

Sweet-type whey is derived from a\nprocess in which there is insigni ﬁcant conversion of lactose to\nlactic acid. Whey protein concentrate is a liquid or dry productthat is obtained by the removal of suf ﬁcient non-protein\nconstituents from whey so that the ﬁnished dry product\ncontains not less than 25.0% protein, while whey protein\nisolate is a liquid or dry product that is obtained by removing\nsufﬁcient non-protein constituents from whey so that the\nﬁnished dry product contains not less than 90% protein. Whey\nprotein concentrate and whey protein isolate are produced byphysical separation techniques such as precipitation, ﬁltration,\ndialysis and/or ion exchange.\nComposition\nCasein. Casein is reported to have all the amino acids con-\nsidered to be essential for human nutrition.15\nHydrolyzed Milk Protein. The amino acid distribution in a\nHydrolyzed Milk Protein product is presented in Table 2. AHydrolyzed Milk Protein (MW = 1250 Da) raw materialproduced by enzymatic hydrolysis was reported to be 81.0 to\n93.8% pure.\n25Sodium chloride content was ≤10% and\nmoisture content was ≤5%.\nImpurities\nThe ingredients in this safety assessment are bovine sourced;\nhowever, the US FDA does not consider milk or processedmilk ingredients as risk materials for transmission of infec-\ntious agents (i.e. bovine spongiform encephalopathy) in\ncosmetic products (21 CFR §700.27).\nThe World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) rec-\nommends that “when authorizing import or transit of [milk\nand milk products] and any products made from these com-modities and containing no other tissues from cattle, veteri-nary authorities should not require any BSE related conditions[i.e. restrictions], regardless of the BSE risk status of the cattle\npopulation of the exporting country, zone, or compartment. ”\n26\nThe Food Chemicals Codex, a compendium of interna-\ntionally recognized standards published by the United StatesPharmacopeia (USP) for the purity and identity of food in-gredients, states that the acceptable lead limit for Casein andcaseinate salts is no more than 1 mg/kg.\n15Acid casein should\ncontain not less than 90% protein calculated on a dry basis.The acceptable lead limit in α-lactalbumin (non-hydrolyzed\nform of Hydrolyzed Lactalbumin) is no more than .5 mg/kg on\nthe dried basis, and the acceptable phosphorus limit is no morethan 700 µg/g. α-Lactalbumin may also contain β--\nlactoglobulin (no more than 6.5% calculated on total proteinbasis), lactose (no more than 1.0%), and lipids (no more than1.0%). Whey, whey protein concentrate, and whey proteinisolate may contain no more than .5 mg/kg lead calculated onthe dried basis. Whey protein isolate should contain not less\nthan 90% protein calculated on a dry basis.Hydrolyzed Casein. A supplier reported that a Hydrolyzed\nCasein product (MW = 600 Da, 30% solution in water) did notcontain more than 5 ppm heavy metals and not more than .5ppm arsenic.\n17\nHydrolyzed Milk Protein. A Hydrolyzed Milk Protein product\nwas reported to have a maximum microbiological count\nof 500 organisms per gram (opg), with yeast and moldsb e i n g<1 0 0o p g .\n18\nUnited States Pharmacopeia\nCosmetic\nThe safety of the cosmetic ingredients included in this as-\nsessment is evaluated based on data received from the FDAand the cosmetics industry on the expected use of these in-gredients in cosmetics. Use frequencies of individual ingre-dients in cosmetics are collected from manufacturers andreported by cosmetic product category in the FDA VoluntaryCosmetic Registration Program (VCRP) database. Use con-centration data are submitted by Industry in response to\nsurveys conducted by the Personal Care Products Council\n(Council) of maximum reported use concentrations by productcategory.\nAccording to 2017 VCRP data, Hydrolyzed Milk Protein is\nused in 189 formulations; the majority of uses are in leave-onproducts (Table 3).\n27Whey Protein has the second greatest\nnumber of overall uses reported, with a total of 67; the ma-jority of the uses are in leave-on formulations. The results of\nthe concentration of use survey conducted in 2016 by the\nCouncil indicate Sodium Caseinate has the highest reportedmaximum concentration of use; it is used at up to 96.9% inbath oils, tablets, and salts.\n28,29The highest reported maxi-\nmum concentration of use in a leave-on formulation for thisingredient is .1% in a face and neck skin care product. Caseinhas the highest reported maximum concentration of use in aleave-on product and is used at up to 2% in makeup prepa-\nrations. Ingredients with neither reported uses in the VCRP\nnor by Council are listed in Table 4.\nIn some cases, reports of use were received from the VCRP,\nbut no concentration of use data were provided. For example,Milk Protein Extract is reported to be used in 4 formulations,but no use concentration data were provided. In other cases, nouses were reported to the VCRP, but a maximum use con-centration was provided in the industry survey. For example,\nCasein was not reported in the VCRP database to be in use, but\nthe industry survey indicated that it is used at concentrationsup to 2% in makeup preparations. It should be presumed thatCasein is used in at least 1 cosmetic formulation for eachcategory for which it is reported to be used.\nSome of these ingredients may be used in products that can\ncome into contact with mucous membranes and the eyes. Forexample, Sodium Caseinate is used in bath oils, tablets, and\nsalts at up to 96.9% and Milk Protein is used in eye makeup46S International Journal of Toxicology 41(Supplement 2)Table 3.

Conservativeestimates of inhalation exposur es to respirable particles\nduring the use of loose powder cosmetic products are 400-fold to 1000-fold less than protective regulatory andguidance limits for inert airbor ne respirable particles in the\nworkplace.\n34-36The milk protein and protein-derived ingredients described\nin this safety assessment are not restricted from use in any wayunder the rules governing cosmetic products in the EuropeanUnion.\n37\nNon-Cosmetic\nAccording to the FDA, bovine milk is considered generally\nr e c o g n i z e da ss a f e( G R A S )a si ti sas u b s t a n c eu s e di nf o o dprior to January 1, 1958, through experience based oncommon use in food (21 CFR§170.30). The FDA has also\ndetermined that the use of peptones as direct food sub-\nstances is GRAS. These GRAS peptones are de ﬁned as “the\nvariable mixture of polypeptides, oligopeptides, and aminoacids that are produced by partial hydrolysis of casein …or\nlactalbumin (whey protein) (21 CFR §184.1553). Addi-tionally, Casein is GRAS as substances migrating to foodfrom paper and paperboard products (21CFR §182.90).Sodium Caseinate is GRAS for human and animal con-\nsumption (21CFR§182.1748, 21CFR§582.1748). Whey is\nGRAS for human consumption (21CFR§184.1979). Labelingrequirements for milk-related ingredients and hydrolyzedproteins in food that is GRAS for human consumption aredeﬁned in 21CFR101.4 and 21CFR102.22.\nCalcium Caseinate and Sodium Caseinate are used in over\nthe counter (OTC) weight control drug products, but theseactive ingredients do not have adequate data available to be\ngenerally recognized as safe and effective for these speci ﬁed\nuses (21 CFR§ 310.545). These casein salts and whey protein,in mixtures with other substances, are also being investigatedfor use as drug coatings and topical drug delivery systems,respectively.\n38-40\nThe FDA requires allergen labeling when 1 or more of the 8\nmajor food allergens, such as milk, are included in food.41\nCasein and caseinate salts, α-lactalbumin, whey, whey\nprotein concentrate, and whey protein isolate are all listed inTable 3.

Whey and whey proteinconcentrate are described as t exturizers and nutrients, with\nthe concentrate also used as an emulsi ﬁer, water-binding\naid, and gelling agent in food s. Whey protein isolate is\nconsidered a source of high-quality protein that may also beused as a gelling agent, water-binding aid, foaming orwhipping aid, emulsi ﬁer, and an edible coating used as a\nmoisture barrier.\nToxicokinetics\nHydrolyzed Milk Protein\nWhile no experimental data were available for the dermal\nabsorption of Hydrolyzed Milk Protein, it was noted thatgastro-intestinal absorption allows for substantially greater\nbioavailability than dermal absorption.\n42In worst-case sce-\nnarios of oral exposures greater than 2000 mg/kg, no signs ofsystemic toxicity were observed and, therefore, it was con-cluded that no systemic toxicity would occur with cutaneousexposure.\nToxicological Studies\nBovine milk, milk proteins, and milk protein derivatives areGRAS food substances, and daily exposures from food usewould result in much greater systemic exposures than thoseresulting from use in cosmetic products. Consequently, sys-temic toxicity potential for these ingredients is not addressedfurther in this report. The safety assessment focuses on thepotential for irritation and sensitization from topical exposureto these milk ingredients.\nGenotoxicity\nHydrolyzed Casein\nThe mutagenic potential of a Hydrolyzed Casein product\n(MW = 600 Da, 30% solution in water) was studied in an\nAmes test using Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98,\nTA100, TA1535, and TA1537 and Escherichia coli strain\nWP2uvrA, with and without S9 metabolic activation.17\nConcentrations were tested up to 5000 μg/plate. The test\nmaterial did not induce reverse mutations with or withoutS9. It was concluded that Hydrolyzed Casein was notmutagenic.\nHydrolyzed Milk Protein\nThe potential of Hydrolyzed Milk Protein to induce genemutation was studied in S. typhimurium strains TA 98, TA\n100, TA 1535, and TA 1537 with and without S9 metabolicactivation.\n42Concentrations were tested up to 5000 μg/plate.\nThe test material did not induce reverse mutations with orwithout S9. It was concluded that Hydrolyzed Milk Proteinwas not mutagenic.\nCarcinogenicity\nTumor Suppression\nSeveral studies have investigated the carcinogenic effects of\nmilk and its related proteins and protein derivatives in the diet,\nand the results indicated that these substances may suppress\ntumor formation.43-45Review articles of the role of milk\nproteins and hydrolyzed proteins on cancer reported thatCasein and casein peptides have antimutagenic properties, andthat animal models for colon and mammary tumorigenesis(like the study described below) showed that HydrolyzedWhey Protein suppressed tumor development.\n46-48The tumor\nsuppression observed in studies with Hydrolyzed Whey\nProtein has been attributed to the high content of cystine/\ncysteine and γ-glutamylcyst(e)ine dipeptides in the milk\nproteins, which are ef ﬁcient substrates for synthesizing glu-\ntathione, an important cellular antioxidant.\nAn example of tumor suppression is the effect of milk\nproteins on the ability of dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA) toinduce mammary tumors in pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats.\n45\nThe rats (number not reported) were fed diets that included\n20% Casein, Hydrolyzed Casein, Whey Protein, or Hydro-\nlyzed Whey Protein starting on gestation day 4. The offspringof these rats were fed the same diet. At 50 d, the femaleoffspring (44 - 49 rats/group) were dosed by gavage withsesame oil containing 80 mg/kg DMBA and were killed62 d post-treatment. The rats that were fed Hydrolyzed WheyProtein had an adenocarcinoma incidence of 17% compared torats fed Casein (34%), Hydrolyzed Casein (33%), and Whey\nProtein (36%) ( P< .001). The median palpable tumor latency\nfor rats fed Hydrolyzed Whey Protein (61 d, P< .001) was\ngreater compared to those fed Casein (44 d), HydrolyzedCasein (42 d), or Whey Protein (45 d). When compared to ratsfed Casein and Hydrolyzed Casein, tumor multiplicity waslower in rats fed Hydrolyzed Whey Protein (1.5 vs 3.0, P<\n.05). The authors of the study concluded that dietary intake ofHydrolyzed Whey Protein reduced DMBA-induced mam-\nmary tumor formation.\nOther Relevant Studies\nType 1 Hypersensitivity\nBovine milk protein is a major food allergen that can produce\nType 1 (immediate) reactions in sensitized individuals, in-cluding up to 8% of children.\n49,50The allergy to bovine milk\nprotein usually occurs in infancy and childhood and is oftenoutgrown by age 5, but approximately 15% to 20% of allergicchildren remain allergic into adulthood with increased levelsBurnett et al. 49Sof immunoglobulin E (IgE), especially IgE to bovine-sourced\nproteins. The IgE-mediated reaction may include cutaneous,respiratory, and gastrointestinal reactions that may on rareoccasions result in systemic anaphylaxis.\n1,49,50Non-IgE-\nmediated reactions may also occur, but these are not as\nwell characterized.50While the reactions may be to any of the\nproteins found in milk, reactions are most commonly linked toα-lactalbumin, β-lactoglobulin, and casein.\nDermal Irritation and Sensitization Studies\nIrritation and Sensitization\nDermal irritation and sensitization studies are presented in\nTable 5 and Table 6, respectively.17,24,42,51-58The results of\nin vitro assays predicted no pot ential for irritation to Hy-\ndrolyzed Milk Protein or Hydrolyzed Yogurt Protein whentested undiluted.

The third group of patients included 28 adults with\natopic dermatitis and was also tested with 1 to 3 protein\nhydrolysates via a skin prick test.\nOf all 3 groups tested, positive reactions were seen in a total\nof 12 patients (all female with atopic dermatitis) from ex-posure to 3 of the 22 protein hydrolysates. All 12 had reactionsto hydroxypropyl trimonium hydrolyzed collagen. One of the12 also had a reaction to hydroxypropyl trimonium hydro-lyzed milk protein (not an ingredient in this report) while 3\nothers had a reaction to 1 trademarked version of hydrolyzed\ncollagen. No adverse reactions to Hydrolyzed Milk Proteinwere observed in the 1271 patients tested .\n61\nSummary\nHydrolyzed Milk Protein is used in 189 formulations; themajority of uses are in leave-on products. Whey Protein has\nthe second greatest number of overall uses reported, with a\ntotal of 67; the majority of the uses are in leave-on formu-lations. Sodium Caseinate has the highest reported maximumconcentration of use; it is used at up to 96.9% in bath oils,tablets and salts. The highest reported maximum concentrationof use in a leave-on formulation for this ingredient is .1% in aface and neck skin care product. Casein has the highest re-ported maximum concentration of use in a leave-on product\nand is used at up to 2% in makeup preparations.\nBovine milk, milk proteins, and milk protein derivatives\nare GRAS, and daily exposures from food use would result inmuch greater systemic doses than those resulting from use incosmetic products. The safety assessment focuses on thepotential for irritation and sensitization from topical exposureto these milk ingredients.\nHydrolyzed Milk Protein and Hydrolyzed Casein were not\nmutagenic at concentration up to 5000 μg/plate in Ames\nassays.\nCasein and casein peptides are reported to have anti-\nmutagenic properties, and animal models for colon andmammary tumorigenesis have shown that Whey Protein andHydrolyzed Whey Protein suppressed tumor development.The tumor suppression observed in studies with HydrolyzedWhey Protein have been attributed to the high content of\ncystine/cysteine and γ-glutamylcyst(e)ine dipeptides in themilk proteins, which are ef ﬁcient substrates for synthesizing\nglutathione, an important cellular antioxidant.\nBovine milk protein is a major food allergen that can\nproduce Type 1 reactions in sensitized individuals, especiallychildren. The IgE-mediated reaction may include cutaneous,respiratory, and gastrointestinal reactions that may, on rare oc-casions, result in systemic anaphylaxis. While the reactions maybe to any of the proteins found in milk, reactions are mostcommonly linked to α-lactalbumin, β-lactoglobulin, and casein.\nHydrolyzed Milk Protein (concentration not reported) was\nnegative in an in vitro dermal irritation assay. Hydrolyzed\nMilk Protein was not irritating to rabbits or humans whentested at up to 25% and 5%, respectively. Hydrolyzed Casein(MW = 600 Da) was not irritating to humans when tested in a30% solution in water.\nNo dermal sensitization was observed in a guinea pig\nmaximization study of Hydrolyzed Milk Protein at up to100%. No sensitization was observed in a study of Hydrolyzed\nMilk Protein in sensitized patients (concentration not re-\nported). Hydrolyzed Casein (MW = 600 Da) was not sensi-tizing in a HRIPT when tested in a 30% solution in water.\nHydrolyzed Milk Protein was not a photoirritant or a\nphotosensitizer in human subjects when tested at 5%.\nNo ocular irritation was predicted to Hydrolyzed Milk Protein\n(concentration not reported) or Hydrolyzed Casein (1.5% activeingredient) in vitro assays. Hydrolyzed Milk Protein was not\ni r r i t a t i n gt or a b b i te y e sw h e nt e s t e da tu pt o2 5 % .\nNo adverse effects from cosmetic use of milk protein or\nprotein-derived ingredients were discovered in the publishedliterature.\nDiscussion\nThe bovine milk protein ingredients in this assessment are\nfound in foods, and daily exposures from the consumption of\nfoods can be expected to yield much larger systemic exposuresto these ingredients than those from use in cosmetic products.Bovine milk and bovine milk proteins are generally recog-nized as safe (GRAS) in foods and animal feeds. The Panel didacknowledge that bovine milk proteins are known food al-lergens that can elicit Type I hypersensitivity reactions wheningested by sensitized individuals. However, no relevant\nocular irritation and no dermal irritation or sensitization wereTable 7.

Additionally, according to\ntheir collective knowledge in treating patients with Type 1hypersensitivity, the Panel clinicians have not experienced re-\nsponses to bovine milk protein via dermal exposures. Thus, thePanel was not concerned that Type I reactions would be induced\nby dermal exposure to bovine milk proteins in cosmetics.Table 8.

In leave-on products, the maximumconcentration of use reported in the Casein-derived in-gredients is 2%. Safety test data of Hydrolyzed Casein were\nnegative at up to 30%. Because of these factors, the Panel\nwas not concerned with the use of Sodium Caseinate at sucha high concentration in bath products that are intended to bediluted for use.\nThe Panel discussed the issue of incidental inhalation\nexposure in spray deodorants, hair sprays, face powders, faceand neck sprays, body and hand sprays, and fragrances. Therewere no inhalation toxicity data available. Although the Panel\nnoted that droplets/particles from spray and loose-powder\ncosmetic products would not be respirable to any apprecia-ble amount, the potential for inhalation toxicity is not limitedto respirable droplets/particles deposited in the lungs. Inprinciple, inhaled droplets/particles deposited in the naso-pharyngeal and thoracic regions of the respiratory tract maycause toxic effects depending on their chemical and otherproperties. However, coupled with the small actual exposure\nin the breathing zone and the concentrations at which the\ningredients are used, the available information indicates thatincidental inhalation would not be a signi ﬁcant route of ex-\nposure that might lead to local respiratory or systemic effects.A detailed discussion and summary of the Panel ’s approach to\nevaluating incidental inhalation exposures to ingredients incosmetic products is available at the CIR website http://www.cir-safety.org/cir- ﬁndings.\nConclusion\nThe Expert Panel for Cosmetic Ingredient Safety concluded\nthat the 16 bovine milk proteins and protein derivatives listedbelow are safe in cosmetics in the present practices of use andconcentration described in this safety assessment.\nAmmonium Caseinate* Hydrolyzed Yogurt Protein\nCalcium Caseinate* Lactoglobulin\nCasein Milk ProteinCasein Extract* Milk Protein ExtractHydrolyzed Casein Potassium Caseinate*Hydrolyzed Lactalbumin* Sodium CaseinateHydrolyzed Milk Protein Sodium Hydrolyzed Casein*Hydrolyzed Whey Protein Whey Protein\n*Not reported to be in current use.

Alan Andersen, PhD3\nAbstract\nSodium cetearyl sulfate is the sodium salt of a mixture of cetyl and stearyl sulfate. The other ingredients in this safety assessment\nare also alkyl salts, including ammonium coco-sulfate, ammonium myristyl sulfate, magnesium coco-sulfate, sodium cetyl sulfate,\nsodium coco/hydrogenated tallow sulfate, sodium coco-sulfate, sodium decyl sulfate, sodium ethylhexyl sulfate, sodium myristyl\nsulfate, sodium oleyl sulfate, sodium stearyl sulfate, sodium tallow sulfate, sodium tridecyl sulfate, and zinc coco-sulfate. These\ningredients are surfactants used at concentrations from 0.1% to 29%, primarily in soaps and shampoos. Many of these ingredients\nare not in current use. The Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) Expert Panel previously completed a safety assessment of sodium\nand ammonium lauryl sulfate. The data available for sodium lauryl sulfate and ammonium lauryl sulfate provide sufficient basis for\nconcluding that sodium cetearyl sulfate and related alkyl sulfates are safe in the practices of use and concentration described in the\nsafety assessment.\nKeywords\nsafety, cosmetics, sodium cetearyl sulfate\nIntroduction\nSodium cetearyl sulfate is a surfactant and/or cleansing agent\nfound in a number of cosmetic products. In 1992, the Cosmetic\nIngredient Review (CIR) Expert Panel concluded that sodium\ncetearyl sulfate was safe as a cosmetic ingredient in the (then)\npresent practices of use and concentration.1This safety assess-\nment was re-reviewed in 2007 to consider new data relevant to\nthe safety of this ingredient. The Panel reaffirmed the original\nconclusion for sodium cetearyl sulfate and determined that the\navailable data in the original safety assessment are sufficient to\nsupport the safety of an additional 14 cosmetic ingredients in\nthe alkyl sulfate family:\n/C15Ammonium coco-sulfate,\n/C15Ammonium myristyl sulfate,\n/C15Magnesium coco-sulfate,\n/C15Sodium cetyl sulfate,\n/C15Sodium coco/hydrogenated tallow sulfate,\n/C15Sodium coco-sulfate,\n/C15Sodium decyl sulfate,\n/C15Sodium ethylhexyl sulfate,\n/C15Sodium myristyl sulfate,\n/C15Sodium oleyl sulfate,\n/C15Sodium stearyl sulfate,\n/C15Sodium tallow sulfate,/C15Sodium tridecyl sulfate, and\n/C15Zinc coco-sulfate.\nThese are considered as salts of sulfate esters or alkyl sulfates.\nThis safety assessment is a combination of the original\nsafety assessment and the re-review document and includes the\navailable data on the chemically similar ingredients.\nThe CIR Expert Panel previously published a safety assess-\nment of sodium lauryl sulfate and ammonium lauryl sulfate,\nfinding them safe in formulations designed for discontinuous,\nbrief use followed by thorough rinsing from the surface of the\nskin. In products intended for prolonged contact with the skin,\nconcentrations should not exceed 1 %.2In a re-review that\nconsidered over 250 new studies, the Panel reaffirmed that con-\nclusion.3Previously reviewed related ingredients, including\nfatty alcohols that are used to make this group of alkyl sulfates,\nare listed in Table 1.\n1Cosmetic Ingredient Review Scientific Analyst/Writer\n2Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel Member\n3Director, Cosmetic Ingredient Review\nCorresponding Author:\nMonice Fiume, Cosmetic Ingredient Review, 1101 17th Street, NW, Suite 412,\nWashington, DC 20036, USA.\nEmail: cirinfo@cir-safety.orgInternational Journal of Toxicology\n29(Supplement 2) 115S-132S\nªThe Author(s) 2010\nReprints and permission:\nsagepub.com/journalsPermissions.nav\nDOI: 10.1177/1091581810364665\nhttp://ijt.sagepub.com\n115Chemistry\nDefinition and Structure\nAs given in the International Cosmetic Ingredient Dictionary\nand Handbook ,9the definitions, synonyms, formulas, and func-\ntions of ingredients included in this safety assessment are given\nin Table 2.\nSodium cetearyl sulfate is commercially available as a mix-\nture of sodium salts of saturated fatty alcohol–sulfuric acid\nesters. Such a mixture consists of approximately equal parts\nof sodium cetyl sulfate and sodium stearyl sulfate.10\nChemical and Physical Properties\nSodium cetearyl sulfate is dispersible in most fatty substances\nand is also available as a 15 %aqueous paste.10Chemical and\nphysical properties of some of the ingredients in this report are\ngiven in Table 3.\nMethods of Manufacture\nSodium alkyl sulfates can be synthesized from their corre-\nsponding alkyl alcohol by treating alcohol with a calculated\namount of sulfuric acid, neutralizing the mixture with sodium\nhydroxide, and filtering rapidly.18The filtrate is evaporated\nand cooled, forming crystals.\nAccording to the International Cosmetic Ingredient Diction-\nary and Handbook ,9sodium cetearyl sulfate, sodium cetyl sul-\nfate, sodium coco/hydrogenated tallow sulfate, and sodium\noleyl sulfate have animal, plant, and synthetic sources. Ammo-\nnium coco-sulfate, ammonium myristyl sulfate, magnesium\ncoco-sulfate, sodium coco-sulfate, sodium myristyl sulfate, and\nzinc coco-sulfate have plant and synthetic sources. Sodium\nstearyl sulfate and sodium tallow sulfate have animal andsynthetic sources. Sodium decyl sulfate and sodium tridecyl\nsulfate have a synthetic source.\nSodium cetearyl sulfate. Sodium cetearyl sulfate may be pro-\nduced via the sulfation of cetearyl alcohol with chlorosulfonic\nacid, sulfur trioxide, or sulfamic acid, followed by neutraliza-\ntion of the acid ester with sodium hydroxide.19\nSodium myristyl sulfate. Sodium myristyl sulfate can be produced\nby the sulfation of myristyl alc ohol with chlorosulfonic acid.15\nAnalytical Methods\nSodium cetearyl sulfate. Sodium cetearyl sulfate has been\nidentified via infrared spectroscopy.10\nSodium ethylhexyl sulfate. Sodium ethylhexyl sulfate has been\nidentified via thin-layer chromatography, gas chromatography,\nand infrared, ultraviolet/visible, and nuclear magnetic reso-\nnance spectra.13\nSodium myristyl sulfate. Sodium myristyl sulfate has been\nidentified by gas chromatography.20\nImpurities\nThe following impurities are present in sodium cetearyl sulfate:\ninorganic chloride (2.2 %maximum), unsulfated matter (4 %\nmaximum), and inorganic sulfate (5.5 %maximum).10\nUse\nCosmetic\nAvailable use information for ingredients is given in Table 4.\nThere are no current reported uses for ammonium coco-\nsulfate, ammonium myristyl sulfate, magnesium coco-sulfate,Table 1.

Sodium ethylhexyl sulfate is used in\ntextile manufacturing and food processing.25It is a surfactant\nused as a wetting and dispersing agent in the textile indus-\ntry.12,13It is used industrially, especially in textile technology,\nto obtain spreading and penetration of aqueous solutions.\nSodium ethylhexyl sulfate has also been used at concentrations\nof/C211%in alkaline solutions used to peel fruits and vegetables.\nGeneral Biology\nAbsorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion\nSodium ethylhexyl sulfate. The dermal absorption of undiluted\nsodium ethylhexyl sulfate was determined by holding saturated\ncotton pads in contact with the skin of 30 guinea pigs for\n4 days.26The authors stated that when the dose applied was\nequal to the oral LD 50, some of the animals died, indicating\nto the authors a slow but fairly complete penetration of intact\nskin; no other details were given. The authors did note that a\ndefinitive conclusion could not be made about penetration\nbased on these data.\nThe metabolism and excretion of sodium ethylhexyl sulfate\nwas investigated using groups of 6 male Carworth Farms-Elias\nrats.27The animals were dosed orally by gavage with a solution\nof 99 mg commercial sodium ethylhexyl sulfate and 1.0 mg of\neither [14C] or [35S]2-ethylhexyl sulfate (1.0 mc/mg specific\nactivity). For the [14C] studies, urine, feces, and respiratory car-\nbon dioxide (CO 2) were collected for 4 days. For the [35S] stud-\nies, urine and feces were collected for 3 days. At the end of theTable 3.

The acute oral toxicity of undiluted\nsodium cetearyl sulfate was evaluated using fasted, Wistar-\nderived albino rats (5 males, 5 females; weights ¼200-250\ng).29Each animal received a dose of 5.0 mL/kg of the test sub-\nstance via gavage. The animals were observed for a period of\n14 days. Necropsy was performed at the end of the observation\nperiod. None of the animals died, and gross lesions were not\nobserved at necropsy. Similar results were obtained when Wis-\ntar albino rats (5 males, 5 females; weights 200-300 g) were\ntested with 10.0 %aqueous sodium cetearyl sulfate according\nto the same procedure.30\nIn another study, the acute oral toxicity of sodium cetearyl\nsulfate (in olive oil) was evaluated using 10 male Wistar rats\n(average body weight 150 g). The test substance was adminis-\ntered via stomach tube at a dose of 10 g/kg, and the animals\nwere observed for 8 days. The LD 50was not achieved at the\nadministered dose.31\nThe acute oral toxicity of 20.0 %aqueous sodium cetearyl\nsulfate was evaluated using 10 rats (5 males, 5 females; weights\n200-300 g). The animals were fed a dose of 5 mL/kg of test\nmaterial and observed for 14 days. None of the animals died.32\nSodium cetyl sulfate. The oral LD 50of sodium cetyl sulfate\nwas determined using groups of 5 albino rats.18The oral\nLD50of sodium cetyl sulfate was >3000 mg/kg.\nThe oral LD 50of sodium cetyl sulfate was reported to be\n>8000 mg/kg for mice, but no details were given.33\nSodium decyl sulfate. The oral LD 50of sodium decyl sulfate\nwas determined using groups of 5 albino rats.18The oral\nLD50of sodium cetyl sulfate was 1950 mg/kg. No further\ndetails were given.\nThe oral LD 50of sodium decyl sulfate was reported to be\n2200 mg/kg for mice, but no details were given.33\nSodium ethylhexyl sulfate. Undiluted sodium ethylhexyl sul-\nfate had an oral LD 50of 10.3 mL/kg for male albino Wistar rats\nand 3.8 mL/kg for male and female guinea pigs (groups of 32-\n48 animals of each species were used).26\nThe oral LD 50of sodium ethylhexyl sulfate was determined\nusing groups of 5 albino rats.18The oral LD 50of sodium ethyl-\nhexyl sulfate was 3200 mg/kg. No further details were\nprovided.\nThe acute oral toxicity of undiluted commercial sodium\nethylhexyl sulfate was evaluated using groups of 5 albino rats\nover a period of 12 years.34The LD 50for male and female rats\nranged from 5.61 to 10.4 mL/kg and 6.5 to 9.19 mL/kg, respec-\ntively. (More males than females were tested.) The researchers\nstated that the difference in the LD 50s did ‘‘not necessarily indi-\ncate changes in the toxicity of commercial production’’ but was\n‘‘probably attributable to minor changes in technique.’’ Shock\nfrom gastric irritation and hemolysis indicative of injury from\noral dosing was observed.The acute oral toxicity of sodium ethylhexyl sulfate was\ndetermined using groups of 5 female albino mice, male albino\nguinea pigs, and male New Zealand giant rabbits.34The oral\nLD50s were 5.19, 1.30, and 3.58 mL/kg for the mice, guinea\npigs, and rabbits, respectively. No further details were\nprovided.\nSodium myristyl sulfate. The oral LD 50of sodium myristyl sul-\nfate was determined using groups of 5 albino rats.18The oral\nLD50of sodium myristyl sulfate was >3500 mg/kg. No further\ndetails were provided.\nThe oral LD 50of sodium myristyl sulfate was 3000 mg/kg\nfor mice, but no details were given.33\nSodium stearyl sulfate. The oral LD 50of sodium stearyl sulfate\nwas determined using groups of 5 albino rats.18The oral LD 50\nof sodium stearyl sulfate was >3000 mg/kg. No further details\nwere provided.\nThe oral LD 50of sodium stearyl sulfate was >8000 mg/kg\nfor mice, but no details were given.33\nAcute Dermal Toxicity\nSodium ethylhexyl sulfate. The acute dermal toxicity of\nsodium ethylhexyl sulfate was determined using groups of\n4 male albino rabbits.34The test article was applied to a clipped\narea of the trunk under a vinyl film that was left in place for\n16 to 24 hours. On removal, the skin was wiped and examined.\nThe animals were observed for 14 days. The dermal LD 50was\n6.54 mL/kg for male rabbits.\nAcute Parenteral Toxicity\nSodium cetyl sulfate. The IP LD 50of sodium cetyl sulfate was\ndetermined using groups of 10 mice, 5 per sex per group.18The\nIP LD 50for mice was 356 mg/kg. No further details were\nprovided.\nSodium decyl sulfate. The IP LD 50of sodium decyl sulfate\nwas determined using groups of 10 mice, 5 per sex per group.18\nThe IP LD 50for mice was 285 mg/kg. No further details were\nprovided.\nSodium ethylhexyl sulfate. The IP LD 50of sodium ethylhexyl\nsulfate was determined using groups of 10 mice, 5 per sex per\ngroup.18The IP LD 50for mice was 396 mg/kg. No further\ndetails were provided.\nThe acute subcutaneous and IP toxicity of sodium ethyl-\nhexyl sulfate was determined using groups of 5 albino rats.34\nThe subcutaneous LD 50was 4.73 and 8.24 mL/kg for 2 groups\nof male rats and 5.62 and 6.16 mL/kg for 2 groups of female\nrats. The IP LD 50ranged from 0.32 to 0.54 mL/kg for 3 groups\nof male rats and was 0.71 mL/kg for 1 group of female rats. An\nintravenous (IV) LD 50was not determined. A 1 %solution of\nsodium ethylhexyl sulfate in 0.75 %sodium chloride was hemo-\nlytic, but none of the rats died as a result of a 5 mL/kg IV\ninjection.\n121Diamante et al 121SSodium myristyl sulfate. The IP LD 50of sodium myristyl\nsulfate was determined using groups of 10 mice, 5 per sex per\ngroup.18The IP LD 50for mice was 342 mg/kg. No further\ndetails were provided.\nThe subcutaneous LD 50of sodium myristyl sulfate for\nFischer 344 rats was 40 mg/kg, but no details were given.35\nSodium stearyl sulfate. The IP LD 50of sodium stearyl sulfate\nwas determined using groups of 10 mice, 5 per sex per group.18\nThe IP LD 50for mice was 477 mg/kg. No further details were\nprovided.\nShort-Term Oral Toxicity\nSodium ethylhexyl sulfate. A group of 10 albino rats were\ngiven 0.25 %sodium ethylhexyl sulfate and groups of 5 albino\nrats were given 0.5 %to 4.0%sodium ethylhexyl sulfate in\ndrinking water for 30 days; the average daily dose was 0.23\nto 1.51 g/kg.26None of the animals died during testing. Occa-\nsional casts, primarily hyaline, were observed in the urine.\nAlbumin was detected in the urine of animals of the 2 %and\n4%dose groups. Microscopically, the kidneys of 2 rats (of 16\nexamined) had slight injury.\nShort-Term Inhalation Toxicity\nSodium ethylhexyl sulfate. Using conventional aerosol cham-\nbers, Hall36exposed groups of 2 guinea pigs to 0.1 %,0 . 5%,\nor 1.0%sodium ethylhexyl sulfate for 8 h/d for 6 days. Controls\nwere exposed to water only. All animals were killed at the ter-\nmination of dosing. None of the animals died during dosing.\nThe animals of the low-dose group showed no effects. The ani-\nmals of the mid- and high-dose groups had dyspnea character-\nized as 1 þand 2þ, respectively, and the high-dose animals\nwere lethargic. The onset of dyspnea was rapid, occurring 1\nto 3 hours after exposure. Only minimal microscopic changes\nwere seen in the lungs.\nThe inhalation toxicity of sodium ethylhexyl sulfate was\ndetermined using groups of 6 male and 6 female albino rats.34\nA0 . 1%aqueous solution was aerosolized to produce droplets\napproximately 2 mm in diameter. The animals were exposed for\n7 h/d for 5 days. Eyes were stained with fluorescein after the\nfirst, third, and fifth exposures. Half of the animals were killed\nand examined on day 6 and the remainder on day 19. Corneal\nnecrosis did not occur. Slight lung congestion was observed;\nthis effect regressed during the 14 days following exposure.\nShort-Term Parenteral Toxicity\nSodium myristyl sulfate. Groups of 5 male and 5 female\nFischer F344 rats were given a daily subcutaneous dose of 0,\n14, 28, 56, 84, 112, or 140 mg/kg sodium myristyl sulfate in\nwater for 14 days.35Animals were examined at study termina-\ntion for toxic effects. No toxic effects were observed with doses\nof/C2084 mg/kg. Some inflammation of the injection site was\nseen at doses of /C2128 mg/kg. The authors reported that some\ndeaths occurred with doses of 112 and 140 mg/kg, although the\nnumber of deaths was not given.These authors also gave groups of 2 adult Beagle dogs,\n1 male and 1 female, a daily subcutaneous dose of 0, 10, or\n40 mg/kg sodium myristyl sulfate in water for 14 days. Animals\nwere examined at study termination for toxic effects. Inflam-\nmation was reported at the injection site of the 40 mg/kg\ngroup.35\nSubchronic Oral Toxicity\nSodium ethylhexyl sulfate. Groups of 10 male and 10 female\nCFE rats, housed 5 per cage, were fed diets containing 0 %,\n0.01%, 0.05%, 0.25%, or 1.25 %sodium ethylhexyl sulfate for\n90 days.34Body weight gains were similar for test and control\nanimals. None of the animals died during the study period. The\nliver weights of high-dose females were significantly decreased\ncompared with the controls. Male and female high-dose ani-\nmals had a significant increase in the incidence of swelling\nof the proximal convoluted tubules of the kidney and the cen-\ntral hepatic cord, with an increase in intrahepatic cell lipoid\ndroplets, compared with controls.\nGroups of 10 male and 10 female F344/N rats and B6C3F 1\nmice were fed diets containing 0, 10 000, 20 000, or 40 000\nppm sodium ethylhexyl sulfate for 13 weeks. None of the ani-\nmals died during the study period. No compound-related\neffects were observed on gross or microscopic examination.\nThe mean body weights of females of all dose groups were\ndecreased by >10 %compared with the controls. Feed con-\nsumption was similar for all animals.\nChronic Oral Toxicity\nSodium ethylhexyl sulfate. Groups of CFE rats, 36 per sex,\nwere fed a diet containing 0 %,0 . 0 1%,0 . 0 4%,0 . 1 6%,o r\n0.64%sodium ethylhexyl sulfate for 2 years.34Four to 8\nanimals/sex per dose were killed at 6, 9, and 12 months;\n20 of each sex were kept until dying or study termination.\nGross and microscopic examinations were performed in all\nanimals. No significant differences between test and control\nanimals were observed in erythrocyte counts, hematocrit\nvalues, weight, or any of the parameters measured or in any\nof the examinations.\nThese same authors also conducted a 2-year study in which\n4 groups of 3 male and 3 female Beagle dogs were fed a diet\ncontaining 0 %, 0.04%, 0.16%, or 0.64 %sodium ethylhexyl sul-\nfate 7 d/wk for 8 months and then 5 d/wk for the remaining 16\nmonths. One female of the 0.16 %dose group died at week 18;\nthe death was not treatment related. No significant differences\nbetween test and control animals were observed in erythrocyte\ncounts, hematocrit values, weight, or any of the parameters\nmeasured or in any of the examinations.\nOcular Irritation\nOcular irritation studies are summarized in Table 5. The total\nocular irritation score is calculated by a formula that gives the\ngreatest weight to corneal changes (total maximum scores ¼80\nfor cornea, 10 for the iris, and 20 for the conjunctiva).\n122122S International Journal of Toxicology 29(Supplement 2)Table 5.

The ocular irritation potential of undi-\nluted sodium cetearyl sulfate was evaluated using male and\nfemale albino New Zealand rabbits. Sodium cetearyl sulfate\nwas classified as a moderate ocular irritant.29\nIn another study, the ocular irritation potential of 20.0 %\naqueous sodium cetearyl sulfate was evaluated using rabbits.\nOcular irritation was not observed at any time during the\nstudy.32\nThe ocular irritation potential of 10.0 %aqueous sodium\ncetearyl sulfate was evaluated using 6 albino rabbits. Sodium\ncetearyl sulfate (10.0 %aqueous) is a moderate, transient irri-\ntant to the rabbit eye when instillation is not followed by ocular\nrinsing.30\nSodium cetyl sulfate. A Draize study was performed to com-\npare the ocular irritation of 2.5 %and 86.5 mmol/L sodium\ncetyl sulfate using 18 and 24 rabbits, respectively.37The aver-\nage irritation scores for the conjunctiva were 21.4 and 24,\nrespectively.\nThe ocular irritation of a C 16alkyl sulfate (sodium cetyl sul-\nfate) was evaluated in rabbit eyes using both the Draize and\nOgura methods.38Results are shown in Table 6.\nIn a Draize test, 50 mLo fa1 %sodium cetyl sulfate solution\nwas instilled into the eyes of 4 rabbits, and the eyes were not\nrinsed.39\nSodium cetyl sulfate is considered an ocular irritant.\nSodium decyl sulfate. A Draize study was performed to com-\npare the ocular irritation of 2.5 %and 86.5 mmol/L using 18\nrabbits for each dose.37The average irritation scores for the\nconjunctiva were 16.5 and 14.7, respectively.\nThe ocular irritation of 0.01 %to 5%of a C 10alkyl sulfate\n(sodium decyl sulfate) was evaluated in rabbits using the\nDraize method and 0.01-and Ogura methods.38Results are\nshown in Table 6.\nThe ocular irritation potential of 0.1 mol/L sodium decyl\nsulfate was determined by instilling 0.1 mL directly on the cor-\nneas of the right eyes of 6 white rabbits.41The eyes were scored\n24 hours after instillation. A total irritation score of 7.37/20 was\nobserved.\nIn a Draize test, 50 mLo fa1%sodium decyl sulfate solution\nwas instilled into the eyes of 4 rabbits, and the eyes were not\nrinsed.39The conjunctiva was scored for irritation (in percent-\nage of maximal possible reactions) at 2, 6, 24, 48, and 72 hoursafter instillation. The scores were 32.5, 27.5, 7.5, 0, and 0,\nrespectively.\nThe ability of 10/C02sodium decyl sulfate to induce opacity in\nthe bovine cornea was examined and measured using an opacit-\nometer. Sodium decyl sulfate produced approximately 85 %\nopacity. Muir reported that sodium decyl sulfate rapidly and\npotently caused opacity.42\nSodium decyl sulfate is considered an ocular irritant.\nSodium ethylhexyl sulfate. The minimal volume of sodium\nethylhexyl sulfate that produced corneal necrosis in the eyes\nof rabbits was 0.005 mL.26The minimum concentration that\nwill produce this injury on excessive application is 8 %.\nThe ocular irritation of sodium ethylhexyl sulfate was deter-\nmined using normal and abraded rabbit eyes.40Concentrations\nof 0.1%to 100%in isotonic saline, pH 7, were examined using\nnormal rabbit eyes. The results are shown in Table 6.\nA Draize study was performed to compare the ocular irrita-\ntion of 2.5 %and 86.5 mmol/L sodium ethylhexyl sulfate using\n18 rabbits for both doses.37The average irritation scores for the\nconjunctiva were 5.9 and 3.2, respectively.\nThe ocular irritation potential of sodium ethylhexyl sulfate,\n39.3%active, was evaluated in a modified eye irritation study\nusing 9 New Zealand albino rabbits.11The maximum total\nscore (MTS) at 24 hours was 52/110 (severely irritating) for\nunrinsed eyes and 54.7/110 (moderately irritating) for eyes that\nwere rinsed.\nIn a Draize test, 50 mLo fa1 %sodium ethylhexyl sulfate\nsolution was instilled into the eyes of 4 rabbits, and the eyes\nwere not rinsed.39The results are shown in Table 6.\nSodium ethylhexyl sulfate is considered an ocular irritant.\nSodium myristyl sulfate. A Draize study was performed to\ncompare the ocular irritation of 2.5 %and 86.5 mmol/L sodium\nmyristyl sulfate using 18 and 24 rabbits, respectively.37The\naverage irritation scores for the conjunctiva were 23.1 and\n21.1, respectively.\nThe ocular irritation of 0.01 %to 5%of a C 14alkyl sulfate\nwas evaluated using both the Draize and Ogura methods.38The\nresults are shown in Table 6.\nIn a Draize test, 50 mLo fa1%sodium myristyl sulfate solu-\ntion was instilled into the eyes of 4 rabbits, and the eyes were\nnot rinsed.39The conjunctiva was scored for irritation (in per-\ncentage of maximal possible reactions) at 2, 6, 24, 48, and 72\nhours after instillation. The scores were 27.5, 25, 5, 0, and 0,\nrespectively.\nSodium myristyl sulfate is considered an ocular irritant.\nSodium stearyl sulfate. A Draize study was performed to com-\npare the ocular irritation of 2.5 %and 86.5 mmol/L sodium\nstearyl sulfate using 18 rabbits for each dose.37The average\nirritation scores for the conjunctiva were 21.4 and 25.4,\nrespectively.\nThe ocular irritation of 0.01 %to 5%of a C 18alkyl sulfate\n(sodium stearyl sulfate) was evaluated using both the Draize\nand Ogura methods.38The results are shown in Table 6.Table 6.

The scores were 12.5, 7.5, 0,\n0, and 0, respectively.\nSodium stearyl sulfate is considered an ocular irritant.\nSodium tridecyl sulfate. The ocular irritation potential of\nsodium tridecyl sulfate, 24.7 %active, was evaluated in a mod-\nified eye irritation study using 9 New Zealand albino rabbits.17\nThe researchers stated that the sodium tridecyl sulfate, 24.7 %\nactive, could be classified as moderately irritating and that irri-\ntation increased with time after instillation.\nIn Vitro/In Vivo comparisons. An assay examining the cyto-\ntoxic effect of anionic detergents using the fluorescein diace-\ntate/ethidium bromide (FDA/EB) test was performed to\npredict ocular irritation in vitro.43According to this assay,\nsodium cetyl sulfate was a statistically significantly more\npotent irritant than sodium myristyl sulfate, which was a statis-\ntically significantly more potent irritant than sodium decyl sul-\nfate. However, in vivo testing indicated that the potency of\nirritation was sodium decyl sulfate > sodium myristyl sulfate\n> sodium cetyl sulfate.\nStern et al compared the EpiOcular assay and the Draize test\nto predict the ocular irritation potential of sodium cetearyl sul-\nfate.44Sodium cetearyl sulfate was predicted to be a moderate\nocular irritant in both.\nDermal Irritation\nSodium cetearyl sulfate. The skin irritation potential of\nundiluted sodium cetearyl sulfate was evaluated by the\nDraize method using 6 albino New Zealand rabbits (3 males,\n3 females; 1.8-2.4 kg). Single applications of the test substance\n(0.5 mL) were made to abraded and intact skin sites that had\nbeen clipped free of hair under occlusive conditions. The mean\nirritation scores at 24 and 72 hours were averaged to calculate\nthe primary irritation index (PII). The PII was 0.8, interpreted\nas slight irritation.29\nIn another study, the skin irritation potential of 20.0 %aqu-\neous sodium cetearyl sulfate was evaluated using 6 albino rab-\nbits. The test substance (0.5 mL) was applied to intact and\nabraded skin sites (2 /C22 cm) that had been clipped free of hair.\nEach site was covered with a patch. After 24 and 48 hours, the\nsites were scored. Skin irritation was not observed at any time\nduring the study.32\nThe skin irritation potential of 10.0 %aqueous sodium\ncetearyl sulfate was evaluated using 6 adult albino rabbits. The\ntest substance (0.5 mL or 0.5 g) was applied, under a patch\nmade of surgical gauze, to shaved intact and abraded skin sites\non the back of each animal. Erythema was observed on abraded\nand intact skin of all animals. In only 1 animal, erythema had\ncleared by 72 hours postapplication. The PII was 1.88, classify-\ning the test substance as a mild irritant.30Ammonium myristyl sulfate. In a review, Ka ¨stner39stated that\nguinea pigs used in an immersion test with 0.25 %ammonium\nmyristyl sulfate had irritation scores that ranged from 8.3 to 10\non a scale of 10 ( no reaction )t o1( strongest reaction ). Details\nwere not provided.\nSodium tridecyl sulfate. A skin corrosion study was performed\non sodium tridecyl sulfate, 24.7 %active, using 6 New Zealand\nWhite albino rabbits.45The test material, 0.10 mL, was applied\nto the shaved intact skin of each animal, and the trunk of each\nanimal was wrapped with a rubberized elastic cloth. The wrap\nwas removed after 4 hours, and the test site was washed. Cor-\nrosion readings were performed 4 and 48 hours after dosing.\n(Destruction or irreversible alteration of the tissue was consid-\nered corrosion.) Sodium tridecyl sulfate, 24.7 %, was found to\nbe a corrosive agent.\nIn Vitro Irritation Tests\nA neutral red (NR) uptake assay using the human keratinocyte\ncell line HaCaT was used to predict the dermal irritation poten-\ntial of sodium cetyl sulfate, sodium decyl sulfate, sodium ethyl-\nhexyl sulfate, and sodium myristyl sulfate.46The results were\nthen compared with irritant responses as measured by transepi-\ndermal water loss (TEWL) and erythema. The decrease in NR\nuptake by HaCaT cells was dose dependent and varied based on\nthe length of the hydrocarbon chain. The cytotoxicity first\nincreased with increasing chain length up to C 12and then\ndecreased. The concentrations that resulted in a 50 %inhibition\nof NR uptake (IC 50) for sodium ethylhexyl sulfate, sodium\ndecyl sulfate, sodium myristyl sulfate, and sodium cetyl sulfate\nwere 1.2, 0.35, 0.175, and 0.5 mmol/L, respectively. The\nresults of the in vivo testing were similar to the in vitro results.\nBoth TEWL and erythema increased with increasing hydrocar-\nbon chain length until a length of C 12, and then a decrease was\nseen.\nDermal Sensitization\nSodium cetearyl sulfate. The skin sensitization potential of\nsodium cetearyl sulfate was evaluated using 20 white female\nguinea pigs of the Pirbright breed (average body weight 463\ng). The control group consisted of 10 guinea pigs. Small quan-\ntities of a 25.0 %aqueous solution of the test substance were\nrubbed into the shaved skin of the hindquarters at 24 hours\nintervals for a total of 10 applications. After a 14-day nontreat-\nment period, 2 applications (24-hour interval) of 1.0 %aqueous\nsodium cetearyl sulfate were made. Reactions were not\nobserved in experimental or control groups at any time during\nthe study.47\nVaginal Irritation\nSodium myristyl sulfate. A vaginal irritation study was per-\nformed using groups of 5 female New Zealand White rabbits.35\nHydrogenated vegetable oil suppositories containing 0, 10, 25,\nor 50 mg sodium myristyl sulfate were administered twice126S International Journal of Toxicology 29(Supplement 2)\n126daily for 7 days. The reproductive tract and urinary bladder\nwere examined grossly and microscopically at study termina-\ntion. No vaginal irritation was observed with twice daily appli-\ncation of the 0 and 10 mg suppositories. Slight-to-moderate\nirritation was observed with the 25 and 50 mg suppositories,\nand 2 of the rabbits of the 50-mg suppository group had mild\ncystitis.\nReproductive/Developmental Toxicity\nNo reproductive or developmental toxicity studies were found.\nGenotoxicity\nIn Vitro\nSodium ethylhexyl sulfate. The mutagenic potential of 100 to\n10 000 mg/plate sodium ethylhexyl sulfate (approximately\n40%active) was determined using Salmonella typhimurium\nstrains TA100, TA1535, TA1537, and TA98 in the presence\nand absence of metabolic activation.13Dimethyl sulfoxide\n(DMSO) was used as the solvent and negative control. Sodium\nethylhexyl sulfate was not mutagenic with or without metabolic\nactivation.\nThe ability of sodium ethylhexyl sulfate (39.6 %purity) to\ninduce chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid\nexchanges (SCEs) was determined using Chinese hamster\novary cells in the presence and absence of metabolic activa-\ntion.48Medium and solvent (distilled water) controls were\nused. The positive controls were mitomycin C and cyclopho-\nsphamide in the absence and presence of metabolic activation,\nrespectively. Sodium ethylhexyl sulfate did not induce chromo-\nsomal aberrations at a dose range of 0 to 5010 mg/mL in the\npresence or absence of metabolic activation. It also did\nnot induce SCEs at a dose range of 0 to 1480 or 0 to\n4980mg/mL without or with metabolic activation, respectively.\nThe positive controls gave the expected results.\nThe mutagenic potential of sodium ethylhexyl sulfate was\nevaluated in the L5178y tkþ/tk/C0mouse lymphoma cell forward\nmutation assay with and without metabolic activation.49The\nvehicle control was DMSO, and the positive control was either\nmethyl methanesulfonate without metabolic activation or\n3-methylcholanthrene with metabolic activation. Without\nmetabolic activation, 2 trials with test concentrations of 200\nto 4200 and 1000 to 5000 mg/mL were negative, 1 trial with test\nconcentrations of 156.25 to 2500 mg/mL was inconclusive, and\n1 trial with test concentrations of 1000 to 4200 mg/mL was pos-\nitive at all concentrations tested. In the inconclusive trial, a\ndose of 1250 mg/mL had a statistically significant increase in\nthe group average mutant fraction, while a nonsignificant\nresponse was seen at the high dose of 2500 mg/mL. With meta-\nbolic activation, 2 trials with test concentrations of 200 or 1000\nto 4200 mg/mL were negative. Trials with test concentrations of\neither 1000 or 2600 to 4200 mg/mL were inconclusive. The\nauthors stated that sodium ethylhexyl sulfate was not muta-\ngenic, based on the weight of the evidence.In Vivo\nSodium ethylhexyl sulfate. The ability of sodium ethylhexyl\nsulfate (approximately 40 %active) to induce sex-linked reces-\nsive lethal mutations in Drosophila was determined using a\nfeeding dose of 50 000 ppm and an injection dose of 5000\nppm.13,14A negative control was used; a positive control was\nnot indicated. Statistically significant changes were not\nobserved.\nCarcinogenicity\nSodium Ethylhexyl Sulfate\nGroups of 50 male and 50 female F344/N rats and 50 female\nB6C3F 1mice were fed 10 000 or 20 000 ppm and groups of\n50 male B6C3F 1mice were fed 5000 or 10 000 ppm sodium\nethylhexyl sulfate (approximately 40 %active) in the diet for\n2 years to evaluate its carcinogenic potential.12,13,25Negative\ncontrols were given untreated feed. All animals that died during\nthe study and those killed at study termination were necropsied,\nand major tissues were examined microscopically. Weight gain\nwas significantly decreased for the high-dose male rats and\nfemale mice. Survival of the treated male rats and male and\nfemale mice was not significantly different from that of the\ncontrols. However, from week 80 until study termination, the\nsurvival of treated female rats was significantly reduced com-\npared with the controls.\nIn the rats, a statistically significant increased incidence of\nchronic focal inflammation (nephritis) was observed in high-\ndose males and was considered associated with dosing. Mild-\nto-moderate hyperplasia of the pelvic transitional epithelium\nwas also observed. An increased incidence of focal calcifica-\ntion of the kidney was observed in high-dose male and female\nrats. A transitional-cell papilloma of the kidney was found in 1\nmale rat and 1 female rat of the high-dose group, and a tubular-\ncell adenoma was found in another high-dose female rat. The\nincidence of transitional-cell papilloma in the high-dose male\nrats was not statistically significantly different from the histor-\nical incidence of the test laboratory or the National Toxicology\nProgram. The incidence of transitional-cell papillomas and\ntubular-cell adenomas in the high-dose female rats was not sta-\ntistically significantly different from the historical incidence of\nthe test laboratory, but it was significantly different from the\nincidence of these lesions in untreated female rats in the\nNational Toxicology Program.\nIn mice, hepatocellular carcinomas occurred in females with\na positive trend, and the incidence in the high-dose group was\ngreater than that of controls using the incidental tumor test.\nHepatocellular adenomas were increased numerically, but the\nincrease was not statistically significant. In female mice, hepa-\ntocellular adenomas or carcinomas (combined) occurred with a\nstatistically significant dose-related trend. In male mice, the\nincidence of hepatocellular neoplasms was comparable among\ntest and control groups. An increased incidence of epithelial\nhyperplasia was found in the forestomach of treated male and\nfemale mice. The increased incidence of this lesion in femaleDiamante et al 127S\n127mice was considered test article–related. In treated male mice,\nthe incidence of this lesion may be test article–related, but the\nevidence was not convincing enough to establish a definite\nassociation.\nThe researchers concluded that there was no evidence of\ncarcinogenicity in male or female F344/N rats or in male\nB6C3F 1mice with sodium ethylhexyl sulfate. For female\nB6C3F 1mice, there was equivocal evidence of carcinogenicity\nas indicated by the marginally increased incidence of hepato-\ncellular neoplasms.\nClinical Assessment of Safety\nIrritation/Sensitization\nThe dermal irritation of 0.1 %and 0.25 %aqueous solutions of\nsodium cetyl sulfate, sodium decyl sulfate, sodium ethylhexyl\nsulfate, sodium myristyl sulfate, and sodium stearyl sulfate was\ncompared in a closed-cup test with a contact time of 22 to 24\nhours.50Details, including the number of participants, were not\nprovided. Sodium myristyl sulfate was reportedly the most irri-\ntating, followed by sodium decyl sulfate and sodium ethylhexyl\nsulfate. Sodium cetyl sulfate and sodium stearyl sulfate did not\nelicit any irritation reactions.\nThe dermal irritation potential of sodium cetyl sulfate,\nsodium decyl sulfate, sodium ethylhexyl sulfate, and sodium\nmyristyl sulfate was evaluated by measurement of TEWL and\nerythema.51Both TEWL and erythema increased with increas-\ning hydrocarbon chain length until a length of C 12, then the val-\nues decreased. The TEWL for both sodium ethylhexyl sulfate\nand sodium cetyl sulfate was approximately 6 g/m2per hour\nand for both sodium decyl sulfate and sodium myristyl sulfate\nwas approximately 11 g/m2per hour. The control value for\nTEWL was approximately 4 g/m2per hour. The erythema\nscore, as determined by skin color reflectance (SCR) measure-\nments, for sodium ethylhexyl sulfate was approximately 8.5,\nfor sodium decyl sulfate was approximately 10.2, for sodium\nmyristyl sulfate was approximately 10.25, and for sodium cetyl\nsulfate was 9.0. The control score for erythema was approxi-\nmately 7.9.\nSodium cetearyl sulfate. TKL Research, Inc, conducted a\nhuman repeat insult patch test with challenge, using a face care\nproduct containing 0.4 %sodium cetearyl sulfate, on 59 partici-\npants (44 females, 15 males; ages 18-65 years old).52Fifty-six\nparticipants completed the study; 2 participants were lost to\nfollow-up, and 1 voluntarily withdrew consent. During induc-\ntion, patches of the product were applied 3 times a week for\n3 weeks. The participants returned after 48 or 72 hours for\npatch removal, and the sites were evaluated after 15 to 30 min-\nutes. After a 2-week rest period, patches were applied to the\noriginal sites and untreated sites and left in place for 48 hours.\nThese sites were evaluated 30 minutes and 48 hours after\nremoval. Some participants may have been rechallenged if a\ndoubtful reaction occurred during the challenge phase. As soon\nas any reactions had resolved, these patches were applied tonew sites on the back for 48 hours and then evaluated at 48,\n72, and 96 hours after application. No adverse events were\nreported.\nInstitute d’Expertise Clinique53studied the cutaneous\nacceptability of a product containing 0.4 %sodium cetearyl sul-\nfate. Forty Chinese participants, 30 to 50 years old, used the\nproduct for 4 consecutive weeks, applying the liquid to the face\nand neck twice a day (morning and evening). There were no\nobserved or reported adverse effects.\nThe irritant action of a number of 0.0225 N alkyl sulfate\nsalts was assessed in 24 males and 14 females with and without\nthe addition of 0.002 N sodium chloride, sodium sulfate, or\nsodium carbonate.54The results are presented in Table 6.\nEffect on Skin Hydration\nSodium cetyl sulfate. The effect of sodium cetyl sulfate on\nstratum corneum (SC) hydration, TEWL, and erythema was\nevaluated using 10 Caucasian participants (sex not specified).55\nA volume of 0.2 mL of a sodium cetyl sulfate solution\n(20 mmol/L) was applied to the volar forearm using occlusive\nplastic chambers; the patches were fixed with nonocclusive\ntape. Evaluations were made 30 minutes after removal and then\ndaily for 7 days. (Readings were not done on the weekends.) SC\nhydration was evaluated by capacitance measurements. TEWL\nwas measured with an evaporimeter. Erythema was quantified\nwith a tristimulus Chroma Meter.\nSodium cetyl sulfate caused an initial decrease in SC hydra-\ntion 1 hour after removal of the test article; the capacitance was\napproximately 46 IU. (The control was approximately 60 IU\nthroughout the study.) By day 2, the SC hydration level was\napproximately 60 IU and not significantly different from the\ncontrols. By day 7, the score was approximately 54 IU. Trans-\nepidermal water loss increased to approximately 15 g/m2per\nhour on day 1 and decreased to approximately 11 g/m2per hour\nby day 2; the value was approximately 7.5 g/m2per hour by\nday 7. (Control values were approximately 5 g/m2per hour\nthroughout the study.) Erythema increased from approximately\n8 on day 0 to approximately 13 on day 1 as measured by tris-\ntimulus SCR. It then decreased over time, reaching a score sim-\nilar to the controls by day 7. The control values were\napproximately 8.0 to 8.5 during the study.\nSodium decyl sulfate. The effect of sodium decyl sulfate on\nskin hydration was determined following the methods\ndescribed previously.55Sodium decyl sulfate also caused an\ninitial decrease in SC hydration 1 hour after removal of the test\narticle; the capacitance was approximately 50 IU. (The control\nwas approximately 60 IU throughout the study.) By day 2, the\nSC hydration level had increased to approximately 65 IU and\nwas not significantly different from the controls. By day 7, the\nscore was approximately 43 IU. Transepidermal water loss was\nincreased compared with the controls. The TEWL values were\napproximately 20 g/m2per hour on day 1, increased to approx-\nimately 24 g/m2per hour on day 2, and then decreased for\nthe remainder of the study reaching a score of approximately128S International Journal of Toxicology 29(Supplement 2)\n1289g / m2per hour by day 7. (Control values were approximately\n5g / m2per hour throughout the study.) Erythema increased\nfrom approximately 8 on day 0 to approximately 10.5 and\n12 on days 1 and 2, respectively, as measured by SCR. It then\ndecreased over time, reaching a score of approximately 9 by\ndays 4 to 7. The control values were approximately 8.0 to\n8.5 during the study.\nSodium myristyl sulfate. The effect of sodium myristyl sulfate\non skin hydration was also determined following the methods\ndescribed previously.55An initial decrease in SC hydration was\nagain observed 1 hour after removal of the test article; the capa-\ncitance was approximately 50 IU. (The control was approxi-\nmately 60 IU throughout the study.) By day 2, the SC\nhydration levels had increased to approximately 62 IU, which\nwas very similar to the control value. By day 7, the score was\napproximately 46 IU. Transepidermal water loss was increased\ncompared with the controls. The values were approximately\n17.5 and 17.0 g/m2per hour on days 1 and 2, respectively; the\nvalues decreased after day 2, reaching a value of approximately\n10 g/m2per hour by day 7. (Control values were approximately\n5g / m2per hour throughout the study.) Erythema increased\nfrom approximately 8 on day zero to approximately 12.5 on\ndays 1 and 2 as measured by SCR, reaching a score of approx-\nimately 9.5 to 9.0 by days 4 to 7. It then decreased over time.\nThe control values were approximately 8.0 to 8.5 during the\nstudy.\nCase Reports\nSodium myristyl sulfate. In a varicose vein clinic, 2300\npatients were treated by injection-compression sclerotherapy\nusing 0.1 %to 3.0%sodium myristyl sulfate.56Allergic reac-\ntions occurred in only 4 patients (0.17 %). One patient devel-\noped periorbital swelling and 3 developed urticaria after their\nfirst treatment. For one of the patients, the reaction developed\n8 hours after treatment. All allergic reactions were of the\nimmunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated type and easily treated with\noral antihistamines.\nSummary\nSodium cetearyl sulfate is the sodium salt of a mixture of cetyl\nand stearyl sulfate (alkyl sulfates) produced via the sulfation of\nthe alcohol with chlorosulfonic acid, sulfur trioxide, or sulfa-\nmic acid, followed by neutralization of the ester with sodium\nhydroxide.\nAll of the ingredients included in this review are surfactants.\nSodium cetearyl sulfate is used in 111 cosmetics at concentra-\ntions ranging from 0.1 %to 10%. In addition, sodium cetyl\nsulfate is used in 11 formulations at 0.3 %to 2%, sodium\ncoco-sulfate is used in 12 formulations at 0.3 %to 29%, sodium\ndecyl sulfate is used in 2 formulations, sodium myristyl sulfate\nis used in 9 formulations, and sodium stearyl sulfate is used\nin 6 formulations. No current uses were reported for ammo-\nnium coco-sulfate, ammonium myristyl sulfate, magnesiumcoco-sulfate, sodium coco/hydrogenated tallow sulfate, sodium\nethylhexyl sulfate, sodium oleyl sulfate, sodium tallow sulfate,\nsodium tridecyl sulfate, or zinc coco-sulfate.\nA number of the alkyl sulfates included in this report are\nindirect food additives. Sodium ethylhexyl sulfate has been\nused in textile manufacturing and food processing. Sodium\nmyristyl sulfate has been used in the treatment of varicose\nveins.\nSodium ethylhexyl sulfate penetrated intact guinea pig\nskin. In an oral study, 91.2 %of a dose of [14C]sodium\nethylhexyl sulfate was recovered in the urine, feces, and\nexpired CO 2. In the urine, 60 %of the radioactivity was\npresent as 2-ethylhexyl sulfate and 30 %as 2-ethyl-2,3-\ndihydroxyhexanoic acid.\nIn acute toxicity tests, sodium cetearyl sulfate, sodium cetyl\nsulfate, sodium decyl sulfate, sodium ethylhexyl sulfate,\nsodium myristyl sulfate, and sodium stearyl sulfate were rela-\ntively nontoxic. All rats survived a 30-day study in which\n0.25%to 4%sodium ethylhexyl sulfate was administered in the\ndrinking water. In a 6-day inhalation study of 0.1 %to 1.0%\nsodium ethylhexyl sulfate, dyspnea was observed in the mid-\nand high-dose groups; only minimal microscopic changes were\nseen in the lungs. In a 5-day study with 0.1 %sodium ethylhexyl\nsulfate, slight lung congestion was observed.\nIn subchronic oral testing, all animals survived dosing with\n/C201.25%or/C2040 000 ppm sodium ethylhexyl sulfate, and\ngenerally no effects due to dosing were observed. In\nchronic studies in which rats and dogs were fed /C200.64%,n o\ncompound-related effects were observed.\nIn ocular irritation tests, in 1 study, 20.0 %aqueous sodium\ncetearyl sulfate was not irritating to the eyes of rabbits, but\n100%and undiluted solutions were moderate ocular irritants.\nSodium cetyl sulfate, sodium decyl sulfate, sodium ethylhexyl\nsulfate, sodium myristyl sulfate, sodium stearyl sulfate, and\nsodium tridecyl sulfate were also ocular irritants.\nIn skin irritation tests, 20.0 %aqueous sodium cetearyl sul-\nfate was not irritating to the skin of rabbits, but 10 %and undi-\nluted solutions were mild irritants. In an immersion study using\nguinea pigs, 0.25 %ammonium myristyl sulfate did not produce\nvery strong reactions. In a study using an occlusive wrap,\nsodium tridecyl sulfate was a corrosive agent to rabbit skin.\nIn a study using rabbits, sodium cetearyl sulfate (tested at con-\ncentrations of 25 %and 1%during induction and challenge\nphases) was not a sensitizer. In a vaginal irritation study, sup-\npositories containing 10-mg sodium myristyl sulfate were not a\nvaginal irritant, while those containing 25 and 50 mg produced\nslight-to-moderate irritation.\nSodium ethylhexyl sulfate was not mutagenic to S typhimur-\niumand did not induce SCEs. In a mouse lymphoma cell assay,\nthe researchers concluded that sodium ethylhexyl sulfate was\nnot mutagenic but could not explain a positive response in 1\ntrial without metabolic activation. Sodium ethylhexyl sulfate\ndid not induce sex-linked recessive lethal mutations in\nDrosophila .\nIn a 2-year feeding study, sodium ethylhexyl sulfate did not\nproduce any evidence of carcinogenicity in male or femaleDiamante et al 129S\n129F344/N rats or male B6C3F 1mice. However, in female\nB6C3F 1mice, there was equivocal evidence of carcinogenicity\nas indicated by the marginally increased evidence of hepatocel-\nlular neoplasms.\nClinical studies were performed on a number of the ingredi-\nents included in this review. In a comparative closed-cup test\nand a study looking at TEWL and erythema, sodium myristyl\nsulfate and sodium decyl sulfate were generally the most irritat-\ning in comparison with sodium cetyl sulfate, sodium ethylhexyl\nsulfate, and sodium stearyl sulfate. This finding indicated that\nirritation increased with increasing hydrocarbon chain length,\nuntil a length of C 12, and then a decrease was generally seen.\nIn clinical irritation studies, sodium cetearyl sulfate did not\nproduce adverse effects. In irritation studies using 38 partici-\npants, sodium decyl sulfate and sodium ethylhexyl sulfate pro-\nduced positive results in 5 %of the participants, sodium\nmyristyl sulfate produced positive reactions in 24 %of the par-\nticipants, and sodium stearyl sulfate did not produce any posi-\ntive results. In tests evaluating the effects on skin hydration,\nsodium cetyl sulfate caused an initial decrease in hydration;\nvalues were similar to controls by day 2. Erythema increased\nuntil day 1 and then reached control values by day 7. The same\neffects were seen with sodium decyl sulfate and sodium myris-\ntyl sulfate. In a case report of patients at a varicose vein clinic,\nwho were treated with sclerotherapy using 0.1 %to 3.0%\nsodium myristyl sulfate, only 0.17 %of the patients had an\nallergic reaction.\nThe CIR Expert Panel has previously completed a safety\nassessment of sodium and ammonium lauryl sulfate that\nincluded subchronic and chronic oral toxicity, reproductive and\ndevelopmental toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, and\nphotosensitization studies. Sodium and ammonium lauryl sul-\nfate were found safe in formulations designed for discontinu-\nous, brief use followed by thorough rinsing from the surface\nof the skin. In products intended for prolonged contact with the\nskin, concentrations should not exceed 1 %. In a re-review of\nthe safety assessment of sodium and ammonium lauryl sulfate\nthat considered over 250 new studies, the Panel reaffirmed the\nconclusion for the salts of sulfated lauryl alcohol.\nDiscussion\nAs discussed in the original safety assessment of sodium\ncetearyl sulfate, there are limited acute oral toxicity, ocular irri-\ntation, and dermal irritation and sensitization data. When these\nlimited data are coupled with the available subchronic and\nchronic oral toxicity, reproductive and developmental toxicity,\ngenotoxicity, carcinogenicity, and photosensitization data\navailable for sodium lauryl sulfate and ammonium lauryl sul-\nfate and when these data are extrapolated to sodium cetearyl\nsulfate, there is a sufficient basis for concluding that sodium\ncetearyl sulfate is safe in the practices of use and concentration\ndescribed in the safety assessment, and that finding is reaf-\nfirmed in this report.\nThe Expert Panel recognizes that in a study examining the\ncarcinogenic potential of sodium ethylhexyl sulfate, there wasequivocal evidence of carcinogenicity, as indicated by an\nincreased incidence of hepatocellular neoplasms, in female\nmice. However, in that the mice used were highly susceptible\nto carcinogenic findings and they were fed a high dose, the\nExpert Panel concluded that there was not a significant car-\ncinogenic potential with regard to sodium ethylhexyl sulfate\nor any of the other ingredients in this report as used in\ncosmetics.\nThe CIR Expert Panel considers that there is little chemical\nor toxicological difference between members of this group of\nsalts of sulfated fatty alcohols. The salts are expected to be dis-\nsociated in any product formulation independent of whether the\nsalt is sodium, ammonium, magnesium, or zinc. Various fatty\nalcohol components for these ingredients are included in\nTable 1. It is the experience of the Panel in its review of fatty\nacids of varying carbon chain lengths that there is little differ-\nence in toxicity. Accordingly, the available data for sodium\ncetearyl sulfate are considered supportive of the safety of the\nentire group as used in cosmetics.\nThe Panel recognizes that use concentration data are not\navailable for all ingredients in this group and that some ingre-\ndients in the group are not in current use. The Panel considers\nthat the ingredients that are not currently in use are not likely to\nbe used at concentrations different from the use concentrations\nfor sodium cetearyl sulfate. Were those ingredients not in cur-\nrent use to be used in the future, the Panel expects that they\nwould be used in products and at concentrations similar to\nthose reported for sodium cetearyl sulfate. In the case of\nsodium myristyl sulfate, which was reported as used in douches\nwhile sodium cetearyl sulfate was not, the Panel referenced the\ninformation in sodium lauryl sulfate, which confirmed its safe\nuse in douches.\nThe Panel recognizes that sodium lauryl sulfate is a dermal\nirritant. It may be used safely in cosmetics by limiting the use to\nrinse-off formulations or by limiting its use concentration in\nleave-on products. Sodium cetearyl sulfate and the related alkyl\nsulfates named in this report are not significant irritants in cos-\nmetic products at the concentrations used, and no restrictions\nare needed.\nConclusion\nBased on the available data, the CIR Expert Panel concluded\nthat sodium cetearyl sulfate, ammonium coco-sulfate, ammo-\nnium myristyl sulfate, magnesium coco-sulfate, sodium cetyl\nsulfate, sodium coco/hydrogenated tallow sulfate, sodium\ncoco-sulfate, sodium decyl sulfate, sodium ethylhexyl sulfate,\nsodium myristyl sulfate, sodium oleyl sulfate, sodium stearyl\nsulfate, sodium tallow sulfate, sodium tridecyl sulfate, and zinc\ncoco-sulfate are safe for use as cosmetic ingredients in the prac-\ntices of use and concentration described in this safety assess-\nment. Were ingredients in this group not in current use to be\nused in the future, the expectation is that they would be used\nin product categories and at concentrations comparable to oth-\ners in the group.130S International Journal of Toxicology 29(Supplement 2)\n130Authors’ Note\nUnpublished sources cited in this report are available from the Direc-\ntor, Cosmetic Ingredient Review, 1101 17th Street, Suite 412,\nWashington, DC 20036, USA.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nNo potential conflict of interest relevant to this article was reported.\nAlan Andersen, PhD, and Monice Fiume are employed by the Cos-\nmetic Ingredient Review.\nFunding\nThe articles in this supplement were sponsored by the Cosmetic Ingre-\ndient Review.

Alan Andersen4\nAbstract\nThe Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) Expert Panel (Panel) rereviewed the safety of 12 isethionate salts as used in cosmetics and\nconcluded that these ingredients are safe in the present practices of use and concentration, when formulated to be nonirritating.\nThese isethionate salts are reported to function mostly as surfactants and cleansing agents in cosmetic products. The Panel\nreviewed the available animal and clinical data as well as information from previous CIR reports. Although there are data gaps, the\nshared chemical core structure, expected similarities in physicochemical properties, and similar functions and concentrations in\ncosmetics enabled grouping these ingredients and reading across the available toxicological data to support the safety assessment\nof each ingredient.\nKeywords\nisethionate salts, safety, cosmetics\nIntroduction\nAs given in the International Cosmetic Ingredient Dictionary\nand Handbook , these 12 ingredients function mostly as surfac-\ntants and cleansing agents in cosmetic products.1The ingredi-\nents included in this report are as follows:\n1. Sodium cocoyl isethionate\n2. Ammonium cocoyl isethionate\n3. Sodium hydrogenated cocoyl methyl isethionate\n4. Sodium isethionate\n5. Sodium lauroyl isethionate\n6. Sodium lauroyl methyl isethionate\n7. Sodium methyl isethionate\n8. Sodium myristoyl isethionate\n9. Sodium oleoyl isethionate\n10. Sodium oleyl methyl isethionate\n11. Sodium palm kerneloyl isethionate\n12. Sodium stearoyl methyl isethionate\nIn 1993, Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) published the\nsafety assessment of sodium cocoyl isethionate, with the con-\nclusion “safe for use in cosmetic formulations at 50 %in rinse-\noff products and at 17 %in leave-on products.”2(p. 477)These\nconcentration limits were based on the maximum concentra-\ntions reported in safety test data at the time. Sodium cocoyl\nisethionate functions primarily as a surfactant-cleansing agentand the majority of the uses reported are in coloring and non-\ncoloring hair products.1,3\nSince the original review, a few new studies were published\nrelating to general toxicokinetics and clinical assessment of\nsafety. These new data have been incorporated in this amended\nsafety assessment.\nIn addition to the original ingredient, sodium cocoyl isethio-\nnate, the ingredients ammoni um cocoyl isethionate, sodium\nhydrogenated cocoyl methyl isethionate, sodium isethionate,\nsodium lauroyl isethionate, sodium lauroyl methyl isethionate,\nsodium methyl isethionate, sodium myristoyl isethionate, sodium\noleoyl isethionate, sodium oleyl methyl isethionate, sodium palm\nkerneloyl isethionate, and sodium stearoyl methyl isethionate\nhave been added to this safety assessment.\n1Cosmetic Ingredient Review Scientific Analyst/Writer, Cosmetic Ingredient\nReview, Washington, DC, USA\n2Cosmetic Ingredient Review Chemis t, Cosmetic Ingredient Review,\nWashington, DC, USA\n3Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel Member, Cosmetic Ingredient\nReview, Washington, DC, USA\n4Former Director, Cosmetic Ingredient Review, Washington, DC, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nLillian J. Gill, Cosmetic Ingredient Review, Suite 1200, 1620 L Street, NW,\nWashington, DC 20036, USA.\nEmail: cirinfo@cir-safety.orgInternational Journal of Toxicology\n2017, Vol. 36(Supplement 1) 5S-16S\nªThe Author(s) 2016\nReprints and permission:\nsagepub.com/journalsPermissions.nav\nDOI: 10.1177/1091581816685552\njournals.sagepub.com/home/ijt\nThe shared core chemical structure, similar functions and\nconcentrations in cosmetics, and the expected similarities in\nphysicochemical properties enabled grouping these ingredients\nand reading across the toxicological data to support the safety\nassessment of each compound in the group. This shared core is\nexpected to carry greater potential to cause any toxic effects\nthat might be associated with exposures to these ingredients, as\nused in cosmetics, than the alkyl chains of varying lengths and\nthe cations (ie, ammonium or sodium), which are not likely to\ncontribute significantly to toxicity. These cosmetic ingredients\ninclude components that have been reviewed previously and\nwere determined by the CIR Expert Panel (Panel) to be safe for\nuse. The conclusions, summary of the findings, and published\ncitations for these previously reviewed ingredients are pre-\nsented in Table 1.\nToxicological data on sodium isethionate (synonym: sodium\n2-hydroxyethanesulphonate) in this safety assessment were\nobtained from robust summaries of data submitted to the Eur-\nopean Chemical Agency (ECHA) by private companies as part\nof the REACH chemical registration process. These data are\navailable on ECHA’s Web site.4\nChemistry\nDefinition and Structure\nThe definitions, structures, and cosmetic functions of the ingre-\ndients addressed in this report are presented in Table 2. These\ningredients share a common 2-hydroxyethanesulfonic acid\nstructural core (Figure 1), which has an alcohol moiety at 1 end\nof a 2-carbon alkyl chain, and a sulfonic acid at the other end\n(that is in an acid salt form in these ingredients). Sodium\nisethionate is the cosmetic ingredient name for the sodium salt\nof 2 hydroxyethanesulfonic acid; the other ingredients are fatty\nacyl esters formed with 2 hydroxyethanesulfonic acid. These\nchemicals have the typical structural components of surfac-\ntants, with a hydrophobic alkyl tail and a hydrophilic sulfonate\nanion at the opposite end.\nPhysical and Chemical Properties\nPhysical and chemical properties of sodium cocoyl isethionate\nand sodium isethionate are provided in Table 3. As noted,\nsodium cocoyl isethionate has limited solubility in water\n(0.01%by weight at 25/C14C). Zwitterionic detergents (betaines),\nalkylamphoacetates, and nonionic sugar surfactants of alkyl\nglucose esters, aldobionamides, gluconamides, glyceramides,\nglyceroglycolipids, polyhydroxy fatty acid amides, and alkyl\npolyglycosides have been used in liquid detergents to increase\nthe solubility of sodium cocoyl isethionate.5\nImpurities\nAs reported in the 1993 safety assessment, sodium cocoyl\nisethionate may contain the following impurities: arsenic\n(3 ppm max), iron (25 ppm max), lead (20 ppm max), sodiumchloride (0.8 %max), free fatty matter (10 %max), sodium\nisethionate (5 %), free fatty acid (18 %), and sodium soap (3 %).2\nUse\nSodium cocoyl isethionate is reported to be a surfactant ingre-\ndient in mild synthetic detergent (syndet) cleansing bars.6\nTable 4A presents the available product formulation data for\nsodium cocoyl isethionate. According to information supplied\nto the Food and Drug Administration by industry as part of the\nVoluntary Cosmetic Ingredient Reporting Program (VCRP),\nsodium cocoyl isethionate was used in a total of 52 cosmetic\nproducts at the time of the original safety assessment. Use\nconcentrations ranged from 10 %to 50%.2Current VCRP data\nindicate that sodium cocoyl isethionate is now used in at least\n490 cosmetic products, with almost half of the uses reported to\nbe in hair dyes and colors.3A survey of use concentrations\nconducted by the Personal Care Products Council in 2013\nreported a maximum concentration of use range from 0.23 %\nto 49.4%.7\nTable 4B presents the 2013 VCRP data and the 2008 use\nconcentration data for the cosmetic ingredients that were added\nto the sodium cocoyl isethionate safety assessment. Currently,\nthe VCRP database indicates that, of the additional ingredients,\nsodium isethionate has the most uses (77), with the majority in\nbath soaps and detergents.3The maximum use concentration\nrange for sodium isethionate was 0.8 %to 6%,w i t ht h e6 %\nreported in bath soaps and detergents.7\nThose ingredients with no reported uses or use concentra-\ntions are listed in Table 4C. Sodium cocoyl isethionate was\nreported to be used in indoor tanning preparations that may\nbe aerosolized and could possibly be inhaled. In practice,\n95%to 99%of the droplets/particles released from cosmetic\nsprays have aerodynamic equivalent diameters >10 mm, with\npropellant sprays yielding a greater fraction of droplets/parti-\ncles below 10 mm compared with pump sprays.8-11Therefore,\nmost droplets/particles incidentally inhaled from cosmetic\nsprays would be deposited in the nasopharyngeal and bronchial\nregions and would not be respirable (ie, they would not enter\nthe lungs) to any appreciable amount.9,10The isethionate salts\nare not restricted from use in any way under the rules governing\ncosmetic products in the European Union.12\nToxicokinetics\nSodium Cocoyl Isethionate\nAn in vitro study of the effects of the size of sodium cocoyl\nisethionate micelles relative to the aqueous pores in the stratum\ncorneum through mannitol skin permeability and average skin\nelectrical resistivity measurements was conducted using female\nYorkshire pig skin.13A sodium cocoyl isethionate solution\n(0.2-200 mM) was applied to the skin in vertical Franz diffu-\nsion cells for 5 hours. The exposure was in the context of a\nhindered-transport aqueous pore pathway model of the\nstratum corneum.6S International Journal of Toxicology 36(Supplement 1)Sodium cocoyl isethionate micelles and the aqueous pores of\nthe stratum corneum had average radii of 33.5 +1a n d2 9 +5\nAngstroms, respectively, as determined with dynamic light-\nscattering measurements. The size of the sodium cocoylisethionate micelles relative to the pore size prevented penetra-\ntion into the stratum corneum. The authors concluded that\nsodium cocoyl isethionate micelles cannot contribute to sodium\ncocoyl isethionate skin penetration and associated skin barrierTable 1. Constituent Acids With Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) Conclusions.\nConstituentConclusion (year issued; maximum\nuse concentration reported) Summary of findings Reference\nCoconut acid\nand palm\nkernel acidSafe as used (2011; coconut and palm\nkernel acid not reported in leave\nons; coconut acid 14% and palm\nkernel acid 12% in rinse-offs)The safety focus of use of the plant-derived fatty acid oils was on the potential\nfor irritation and sensitization since the cosmetic ingredients reviewed\nwere also found in the foods that are consumed daily. 5% aqueous\nsolutions of a bar soap containing 13% sodium cocoate had irritation\nscores of 1.6-4.0/8 in animal studies. However, the remaining animal and\nclinical irritation and/or sensitization studies conducted on a large number\nof the oils included in this report, primarily in formulation, did not report\nany significant irritation or sensitization reactions, indicating that refined\noils derived from plants are not dermal irritants or sensitizers16-18\nLauric acid,\noleic acid,\nand stearic\nacidSafe as used (1987; reaffirmed in\n2006; lauric acid 10%, oleic acid\n25%, and stearic acid > 50% in\nleave ons; lauric acid 25% and oleic\nand stearic acid 50% in rinse-offs)Oleic, lauric, palmitic, and stearic acids are fatty acids with hydrocarbon\nchains ranging in length from 12 to 18 carbons with a terminal carboxyl\ngroup. These ingredients are approved food additives. These fatty acids\nare absorbed, digested, and transported in animals and humans. Little\nacute toxicity was observed when oleic, lauric, palmitic, or stearic acid or\ncosmetic formulations containing these fatty acids were given to rats orally\nat doses of 15-19 g/kg body weight. Feeding of 15% dietary oleic acid to\nrats in a chronic study resulted in normal growth and health, but\nreproductive capacity of female rats was impaired. Results from topical\napplication of oleic, palmitic, and stearic acid to the skin of mice, rabbits,\nand guinea pigs produced little or no apparent toxicity. Studies using\nproduct formulations containing oleic and stearic acids indicate that\nneither is a sensitizer or photosensitizing agent. Animal studies also\nindicate that these fatty acids are not eye irritants. Lauric, stearic, and oleic\nacids were noncarcinogenic in separate animal tests. In primary and\ncumulative irritation clinical studies, oleic and stearic acids at high\nconcentrations were nonirritating. Cosmetic product formulations\ncontaining oleic, lauric, palmitic, and stearic acids at concentrations ranging\nup to 13% were not primary or cumulative irritants nor sensitizers19,20\nMyristic acid Safe as used (2010; 15% in leave ons;\n50% in rinse offs)Myristic acid is approved as a food reagent and additive with a carbon chain\nlength of 14. Myristic acid enhanced the dermal penetration of several\ndrugs. The acute oral LD 50and acute dermal LD 50of salts of myristic acid\nwere >8 g/kg and >16 mL/kg, respectively, in rats. Acute dermal\napplication of butyl myristate (2 g/kg) was nontoxic and nonirritating to\nrabbits. When 10 rabbits were treated with a single dermal dose of ethyl\nmyristate (5 g/kg) resulted in the death of 2 over 7 days. The\nintraperitoneal and subcutaneous LD 50for isopropyl myristate exceeded\n79.5 mL/kg in rats and the intraperitoneal LD 50was >50.2 mL/kg in mice.\nNo death occurred, and no evidence of systemic toxicity was found at\nnecropsy when the rats were exposed to aerosolized isopropyl myristate.\nMyristic acid, isopropyl myristate, and myristyl myristate were minimally\nirritating to the eyes of rabbits. Butyl myristate was nonirritating to the\nrabbit eye. Myristic acid was nonirritating in a single insult occlusive patch\ntest and slightly irritating in a repeat open patch test on rabbits. Butyl\nmyristate was a moderate skin irritant in rabbits and guinea pigs. Isopropyl\nmyristate and myristyl myristate were minimally irritating in several\nformulations in rabbits and mice. Isopropyl myristate was nonirritating\nwhen injected parenterally in albino rabbits. Butyl myristate and myristyl\nmyristate were nonsensitizing to guinea pigs. Isopropyl myristate and\nmyristyl myristate were comedogenic to rabbit ears. Isopropyl myristate\ntested negative in the Salmonella/microsome test, with and without\nactivation. In clinical primary and cumulative irritation studies, myristic acid\nwas nonirritating. Isopropyl myristate can produce slight irritation but is\nnot a human sensitizer at up to 50%20,21Burnett et al 7STable 2.

After the application period, the skin\nsamples were rinsed 4 times with PBS, exposed to an aqueousSRB fluorescent probe solution in the diffusion cells for an\nadditional 24 hours, and then rinsed again 4 times with PBS\nand blotted to remove excess SRB. The skin samples then\nunderwent TPM imaging.\nWhen compared to SDS, sodium cocoyl isethionate had a\nweaker skin barrier interaction, especially in the corneocyte\nenvelopes and the corneocyte keratins. Sodium cocoyl isethio-\nnate did not induce the formation of localized transport regions\nin the skin barrier, and sodium cocoyl isethionate promoted\nSRB penetration into the intercellular lipid bilayers of the stra-\ntum corneum, although this effect is lower than that observed in\nSDS. Sodium cocoyl isethionate did not induce significantly\ndeeper penetration of SRB and had significantly smaller SRB-\nskin partition coefficients and SRB-skin penetration depths, all\nwhen compared to SDS. This study indicates that sodium\ncocoyl isethionate is a mild surfactant relative to SDS because\nit decreases skin penetration of an irritant by reducing porosity\nto tortuosity ratio without reducing average pore radius.6Table 4A.

Erythema was observed at times during the study.1\nAcute Toxicity\nOral—nonhuman\nSodium isethionate. In an acute oral toxicity study, 5 male and\n5 female Wistar rats received 5,000 mg/kg body weight sodium\nisethionate in water (50 %wt/vol).4One female rat died after\nadministration of the test substance. The death was not treat-\nment related. No clinical signs of toxicity were observed in any\nof the rats. Decreased body weight was observed in 1 female\nrat. There were no macroscopic findings at necropsy. The LD 50\nvalue was greater than 5,000 mg/kg body weight.Table 4C.

The toxicity of sodium isethionate was\nevaluated in groups of 10 animals of each sex, except for the\ncontrol group and the high-dose group, which consisted of\n15 animals of each sex. Male and female Wistar rats received\noral doses of sodium isethionate at 50, 200, or 1,000 mg/kg\nbody weight/day in bi-distilled water (10 mL/kg body weight)\nfor 91/92 days via gavage.4The study was performed according\nto Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development\n(OECD) guideline 408. All animals were killed at study end,\nand gross pathology and histopathology examinations\nwere performed.\nAll rats survived until study end. No clinical signs of toxi-\ncity were observed during daily or weekly observations, and no\ntoxicologically relevant ophthalmoscopic changes, differences\nin the mean feed consumption, changes in hematology para-\nmeters at 50 mg/kg/d or 200 mg/kg/d, or changes in urinalysis\nparameters at 50 mg/kg/d were observed. Statistically signifi-\ncant differences were noted in the mean hind limb grip strength\nof males treated with 1,000 mg/kg/d, but these were considered\nto be secondary to decreased body weights. Slightly decreased\nmean absolute and relative body weights were observed in\n1,000 mg/kg/d males. Changes in the hematology parameters\nof 1,000 mg/kg/d group included decreased mean corpuscular\nhemoglobin concentration, increased mean absolute and rela-\ntive reticulocyte counts, and a “left-shift” in the reticulocyte\nmaturity indices indicative of increased reticulocyte turnover\nand decreased hemoglobin distribution width in females only.\nIn 1,000 mg/kg/d rats, the clinical biochemistry parameters\nincluded decreased glucose levels, increased total bilirubin lev-\nels, increased cholesterol and phospholipid levels, and\nincreased aspartate or alanine aminotransferase activities.\nIncreased sodium levels in all 3 dose groups, decreased potas-\nsium levels in all 3 dose groups, increased calcium levels at\n1,000 mg/kg/d, increased phosphorus in females at 1,000 mg/\nkg/d, and increased chloride levels in males at 200 mg/kg/d\nwere also observed. Gross pathology and histopathology find-\nings included increased spleen weights in rats at 1,000 mg/kg/d,\nmacroscopic changes in the liver (increased incidence of tan foci\nin the liver of males and females treated with 1,000 mg/kg/d),\nmicroscopic changes in the liver (degeneration and necrosis\n[focal or single hepatocytes]), bile duct hyperplasia, focal hepa-\ntocytic hyperplasia, peribiliary fibrosis, and an increased inci-\ndence and severity of mixed inflammatory cell infiltration in the\nparenchyma and spleen (increased hemopoiesis) with complete\npostrecovery reversibility. The authors concluded that the no\nobserved adverse effect level (NOAEL) for sodium isethionate\nwas 200 mg/kg body weight/day.4\nReproductive and Developmental Effects\nSodium Isethionate\nThe teratogenic potential of sodium isethionate was studied in\nWistar rats.4Groups of 4 females received once daily oraltreatments of 0, 50, 200, or 1,000 mg/kg body weight sodium\nisethionate in highly purified water (dose volume ¼10 mL/kg)\nfrom day 0 to day 20 postcoitum. During the treatment period,\nthe dams were observed for clinical signs of toxicity, and feed\nconsumption and body weights were measured. All dams were\nkilled on day 21 postcoitum for necropsy and the fetuses were\nremoved by cesarean delivery for examination. All dams sur-\nvived until the scheduled necropsy and no clinical signs of\ntoxicity were observed. Feed consumption was marginally\ndecreased when compared to the controls in the high-dose\ngroup, but the body weight gains were within normal para-\nmeters and this observation was not considered toxicologically\nrelevant. Feed consumption and body weight gains were within\nnormal parameters in the remaining dose groups. Preimplanta-\ntion and postimplantation loss and the mean number of fetuses\nper dam were not affected by treatment with sodium isethionate\nat any dose level. No macroscopic findings were noted during\nnecropsy. In the fetuses, no test material–related effects on sex\nratios or body weights were observed. Also, no test material–\nrelated abnormalities were noted during the visceral examina-\ntion or during the examination of fetal skeletons and cartilages.\nIt was concluded that sodium isethionate was not teratogenic at\nthe doses tested in this study and the maternal and fetal\nNOAEL was considered to be 1,000 mg/kg body weight/day.\nGenotoxicity\nGenotoxicity data were available from an earlier CIR safety\nassessment supporting the safety of sodium cocoyl isethionate.1\nIn Vitro\nSodium isethionate. The genotoxic potential of sodium isethio-\nnate was studied in an Ames test for mutagenicity with Salmo-\nnella typhimurium strains TA 98, TA100, TA 1535, TA 1537,\nand TA 1538 and Escherichia coli WP2uvrA. The test was\nconducted with and without metabolic activation with concen-\ntrations up to 10,000 mg/plate.4Sodium isethionate was not\ntoxic to the bacterial strains. No dose-dependent increase in\nthe number of revertants was observed in any of the bacterial\nstrains with and without metabolic activation. Sodium isethio-\nnate was not mutagenic in this Ames test.\nThe potential of sodium isethionate to induce mutations was\nstudied using the mouse lymphoma thymidine kinase locus\nL5178Y assay according to the OECD guideline 476.4Two\nparallel experiments were performed: the first had a 4-hour\ntreatment period with and without metabolic activation, and\nthe second had a 24-hour treatment period without metabolic\nactivation and a 4-hour treat ment period with metabolic\nactivation. A range-finding experiment preceded the main test-\ning. Sodium isethionate in deionized water was tested at con-\ncentrations up to 1,500 mg/mL. Positive controls were methyl\nmethane sulfonate and cyclophosphamide. No substantial and\nreproducible dose-dependent increase in mutant colony num-\nbers was observed in both main experiments. No relevant shift\nin the ratio of small versus large colonies was observed up to12S International Journal of Toxicology 36(Supplement 1)1,500 mg/mL. The positive controls yielded expected results. In\nthis mouse lymphoma thymidine kinase locus L5178Y assay,\nsodium isethionate did not induce mutations with or without\nmetabolic activation.\nThe potential for sodium isethionate up to 1,500 mg/mL\nto induce micronuclei in human lymphocytes was assessed\naccording to the OECD guideline 487.4Two parallel experi-\nments were performed—in the first, the exposure period to\nsodium isethionate in deionized water was 4 hours with and\nwithout metabolic activation, and in the second, the expo-\nsure period to the test material was 24 hours without meta-\nbolic activation mix and 4 hours with metabolic activation.\nThe chromosomes were prepared 32 hours (experiment 1)\nand 52 hours (experiment 2) after the start of treatment with\nthe test material. No visible precipitation of the test item in\nthe culture medium was observe d. No relevant cytotoxicity,\nindicated by reduced cytochala sin blocked proliferation\nindex and described as cytosta sis could be observed in this\ns t u d yu pt o1 , 5 0 0 mg/mL. In both experiments, with and\nwithout metabolic activation, no biologically relevant\nincrease in the number of cel ls carrying micronuclei was\nobserved.\nCarcinogenicity\nNo relevant published carcinogenicity studies on isethionate\nsalts were discovered, and no unpublished data were submitted.\nIrritation and Sensitization\nIn a previous safety assessment, the irritation and sensitiza-\ntion potential of sodium cocoyl isethionate1was evaluated in\nocular irritation, dermal, and ph ototoxicity studies in rabbits.\nSodium cocoyl isethionate was a mild to a primary ocular\nirritant at 2.5 %to 49%; an ocular irritant at /C2115%and\n15.0%, and pH of 7.0 was moderately irritating to the intact\nand abraded skin. In 2 additional rabbit studies, sodium cocyl\nisethionate was not a primary dermal irritant at 5 %in 1 study\n(but had potential for mild irritation) and was a moderate\nprimary dermal irritant in the other study. A 2 %solution of\na formulation containing 47.5 %sodium cocoyl isethionate\nwas not phototoxic in a test using 4 General Electric\nF-40BLB UV lights, but it was mildly irritating to the skin\nof rabbits. In 2 studies in which a modified Buehler test was\nperformed using guinea pigs, sodium cocoyl isethionate\ntested at concentrations up to 10.5 %did not produce a sensi-\ntization reaction.\nIn human irritation studies, an 8 %aqueous solution of\nsodium cocoyl isethionate produced minimal irritation in\n5 modified soap chamber tests while testing was discontinued\nin the sixth study due to the resulting irritation. A 4 %aqueous\nsolution of a formulation containing 15 %sodium cocoyl\nisethionate was nonirritating. Solutions containing 0.10 %to\n1.0%sodium cocoyl isethionate were mildly irritating, whereas\na4%to 6%solution of a formulation containing 15 %sodium\ncocoyl isethionate was a moderate to severe irritant. An RIPTwas performed using a formulation containing 49.87 %sodium\ncocoyl isethionate at 0.1 %to 0.5%under a closed patch and at\n4.0%to 8.0%under open conditions. The test article did not\nproduce a sensitization reaction. In 2 RIPTs, one using a for-\nmulation containing 17 %sodium cocoyl isethionate and the\nother using a 2 %solution of a formulation containing 47.5 %\nsodium cocoyl isethionate, the test article was not clinically\nirritating and did not induce allergic contact dermatitis. In a\nhuman study using a modified Draize procedure, a formulation\ncontaining 15 %sodium cocoyl isethionate did not produce an\nallergic reaction.1\nIrritation\nDermal—nonhuman\nSodium isethionate. The skin irritation potential of sodium\nisethionate was tested according to OECD guideline 404 in\n3 New Zealand White rabbits.4Approximately 500 mg of\nsodium isethionate in 0.1 mL of isotonic saline was applied\nto shaved skin and semioccluded for 4 hours before being\nrinsed off. The skin did not show any sign of erythema or\nedema up to 3 days after application. Mean scores on all obser-\nvation time points after application were 0 for the 3 animals.\nThe test substance was classified as not irritating.\nOcular—nonhuman\nSodium isethionate. The eye irritation potential of sodium\nisethionate was tested acco rding to the OECD guideline\n405 in 3 New Zealand White rabbits.4Approximately 100\nmg of the test substance (undiluted) was instilled for 24 hours.\nSwelling of the lids and redness of the conjunctiva and iris was\nobserved in the eyes 1 hour after application. The mean scores\nfor the 3 animals on days 1, 2, and 3 for chemosis and redness\nof the conjunctiva were 0.2 and 0.7, respectively. These symp-\ntoms were fully reversible by 48 hours. The test substance was\nnot considered irritating.\nSensitization\nDermal—nonhuman\nSodium isethionate. The sensitization potential of sodium\nisethionate was investigated by an LLNA test according to the\nOECD guideline 429.4Female CBA mice (5 animals/dose)\nreceived the test materials at concentrations of 10 %,2 5%,o r\n50%in ethanol–deionized water (30:70) according to the study\nprotocol. No deaths were observed during the study period. No\nsymptoms of local toxicity on the ears of the mice, and no signs\nof systemic toxicity were observed during the study. The body\nweights were within normal ranges. The positive control, hexyl\ncinnamic aldehyde, yielded expected results. The stimulation\nindices were determined to be 0.46, 0.48, and 0.56 for sodium\nisethionate at 10 %,2 5%, and 50 %, respectively. An EC 3value\ncould not be calculated. It was concluded that sodium isethio-\nnate was not a skin sensitizer in this LLNA test.Burnett et al 13SClinical Assessment of Safety\nSodium Cocoyl Isethionate\nSodium cocoyl isethionate (2.9 %), as well as sodium lauryl\nsulfate (SLS), disodium lauryl 3-ethoxysulfosuccinate (SUC),\nand a sodium soap of fatty acids derived from palm oil and\ncoconut oil (SOAP) were used to evaluate the outcome of\ndifferent irritancy testing methods in 25 volunteers.14In visual\nscoring of 1-time occlusive tests, the irritancy rank order for the\nanionic detergents was SOAP /C21SLS/C21sodium cocoyl isethio-\nnate > SUC, whereas in visual scoring of repeated occlusive\nand open tests, the order was SLS > sodium cocoyl isethionate\n/C21SOAP > SUC. Evaluation of the irritancy testing methods\nusing transepidermal water loss (TEWL) measurements\nyielded similar rank orders for all testing methods.\nThe different aspects of irritant reactions and skin barrier\nrecovery was studied in 8 surfactants, including 5 %sodium\ncocoyl isethionate.15The substances were diluted in a citrate\nbuffer and then applied with Finn chambers to the forearms of\n12 volunteers for 48 hours. Irritancy was evaluated by clinical\nassessment, an evaporimeter, a laser Doppler flowmeter, and a\ncorneometer on the day the patches were removed (day 1) and\nagain on days 2, 5, 9, and 14. Sodium cocoyl isethionate pro-\nduced visual erythema in 42 %,3 1%,2 3%,1 3%, and 10 %of\nt o t a lo nd a y s1 ,2 ,5 ,9 ,a n d1 4 ,r e s p e c t i v e l y .S c a l i n gw a s\nobserved on day 2 in 3 %of total and increased to 22 %by day\n14. The TEWL was elevated on days 1 and 2 with median\nvalues at approximately 37 and 31 g/m2/h, respectively.\nCutaneous blood flow was elevated on day 2. Among the 8\nsurfactants tested, SLS was the most irritating, with sodium\ncocoyl isethionate the next most irritating.\nSummary\nNote that the summary only includes information available\nsince the original safety assessment was published. The origi-\nnal safety assessment should be consulted for details on the\nstudies that support the original conclusion.\nSodium cocoyl isethionate functions primarily as a\nsurfactant-cleansing agent, and the majority of the uses reported\nare in coloring and noncoloring hair products. In 1993, CIR\npublished a safety assessment on this ingredient with the con-\nclusion “safe for use in cosmetic formulations at 50 %in rinse-off\nproducts and at 17 %in leave-on products.” Because of a shared\ncore chemical structure and similar functions, the cosmetic\ningredients ammonium cocoyl isethionate, sodium hydrogenated\ncocoyl methyl isethionate, sodium isethionate, sodium lauroyl\nisethionate, sodium lauroyl methyl isethionate, sodium methyl\nisethionate, sodium myristoyl isethionate, sodium oleoyl isethio-\nnate, sodium oleyl methyl isethionate, sodium palm kerneloyl\nisethionate, and sodium stearoyl methyl isethionate have been\nadded to this safety assessment.\nSodium cocoyl isethionate was reported to be used in a total\nof 52 cosmetic products at the time of the original safety assess-\nment. Use concentrations ranged from 10 %to 50%. Current\nVCRP data indicate that sodium cocoyl isethionate is used in490 cosmetic products, with almost half of the uses reported to\nbe in hair dyes and colors. A survey of use concentrations con-\nducted by the Personal Care Products Council in 2013 reported a\nrange from 0.23 %to 53%. Among the ingredients added to this\namended safety assessment, sodium isethionate has the most\nuses (77) with the majority in bath soaps and detergents. The\nmaximum use concentration range for sodium isethionate was\n0.8%to 6%,w i t ht h e6 %reported in bath soaps and detergents.\nToxicokinetics studies have found that sodium cocoyl\nisethionate micelles cannot contribute to sodium cocoyl\nisethionate skin penetration and associated skin barrier pertur-\nbation. The LD 50value was greater than 5,000 mg/kg body\nweight in an acute oral toxicity study in Wistar rats that\nreceived 5,000 mg/kg body weight sodium isethionate in water\n(50%wt/vol). In a repeated oral dose toxicity study in Wistar\nrats that received sodium isethionate at doses of 50, 200, or\n1,000 mg/kg body weight/day in bi-distilled, the NOAEL was\n200 mg/kg/d.\nSodium isethionate was not teratogenic in Wistar rat dams\nthat received daily oral treatments of 0, 50, 200, or 1,000 mg/kg\nsodium isethionate in highly purified water on days 0 through\n20 of gestation. The maternal and fetal NOAEL were consid-\nered to be 1,000 mg/kg body weight/day.\nSodium isethionate was not mutagenic in an Ames test at\nconcentrations up to 10,000 mg/plate. This ingredient at con-\ncentrations up to 1,500 mg/mL also did not induce mutations in\na mouse lymphoma thymidine kinase locus L5178Y assay, nor\ndid it induce micronuclei in a human lymphocyte assay.\nIn New Zealand White rabbits, sodium isethionate was not a\ndermal irritant, nor was it an ocular irritant. When tested at\nconcentrations up to 50 %in ethanol–deionized water, sodium\nisethionate was not a skin sensitizer in an LLNA test.\nClinical testing of sodium cocoyl isethionate (2.9 %) to com-\npare irritancy potential to other surfactants found that sodium\ncocoyl isethionate was irritating but less irritating than SLS.\nDiscussion\nA safety assessment for sodium cocoyl isethionate was pub-\nlished by CIR in 1993 with the conclusion of safe for use in\ncosmetic formulations at 50 %in rinse-off products and at 17 %\nin leave-on products. These concentration limits were based on\nthe maximum concentrations reported in safety test data at the\ntime. The CIR Expert Panel reopened the final report on\nsodium cocoyl isethionate based on new data and determined\nthat the report should also address the safety of 11 additional\nisethionate salts.\nThe Panel considered that the available data on isethionate\nsalts and noted the lack of systemic toxicity at high doses in\nsingle dose and repeated dose oral animal studies, no teratogenic\neffects in animal studies, and little or no irritation or sensitization\nin multiple tests of dermal and ocular exposure. The Panel\nacknowledged the absence of carcinogenicity data but consid-\nered the data demonstrating that sodium cocoyl isethionate and\nsodium isethionate were not genotoxic in Ames tests and mam-\nmalian assays adequate to support the safety of these ingredients.14S International Journal of Toxicology 36(Supplement 1)A l t h o u g ht h e r ea r ed a t ag a p s ,t h es h a r e dc o r ec h e m i c a l\nstructure, similar functions and concentrations in cosmetics,\nand the expected similarities i n physicochemical properties\nenabled grouping these ingredients and reading across the\navailable toxicological data to support the safety assessment\nof each individual compound in the entire group.\nThe Panel looked at changes in the patterns of use and con-\ncentrations of use since the o riginal safety assessment of\nsodium cocoyl isethionate and noted that the earlier safety\nassessment had specified use concentrations of up to 50 %in\nrinse-off products and up to 17 %in leave-on products as safe.\nThe most recently reported concentration of use of sodium\ncocoyl isethionate in rinse-off products is 49.4 %. The Panel\nnoted that most surfactants exhibit some irritancy, as was the\ncase with sodium cocoyl isethionate at 2.9 %. Thus, the Panel\nstated that products that include these ingredients should be\nformulated to be nonirritating.\nThe Panel discussed the issue of incidental inhalation expo-\nsure from suntan preparations. There were no inhalation toxi-\ncity data available. Sodium cocoyl isethionate is reportedly\nused at concentrations up to 1 %in cosmetic products that may\nbe aerosolized. The Panel believes that the sizes of a substantial\nmajority of the particles of these ingredients, as manufactured,\nare larger than the respirable range and/or aggregate and\nagglomerate to form much larger particles in formulation. The\nPanel noted that 95 %to 99%of droplets/particles produced in\ncosmetic aerosols would not be respirable to any appreciable\namount. Coupled with the small actual exposure in the breath-\ning zone, the available information indicates that incidental\ninhalation would not be a significant route of exposure that\nmight lead to local respiratory or systemic effects. A detailed\ndiscussion and summary of the Panel’s approach to evaluating\nincidental inhalation exposures to ingredients in cosmetic prod-\nucts is available at http://www.cir-safety.org/cir-findings.\nConclusion\nThe CIR Expert Panel concluded that the 12 isethionate salts\nlisted below are safe in the present practices of use and con-\ncentration in cosmetics, when formulated to be nonirritating.\nThis conclusion supersedes the earlier conclusion issued by the\nExpert Panel in 1993.\nSodium cocoyl isethionate\nAmmonium cocoyl isethionate\nSodium hydrogenated cocoyl methyl isethionate*\nSodium isethionate\nSodium lauroyl isethionate\nSodium lauroyl methyl isethionate\nSodium methyl isethionate\nSodium myristoyl isethionate*\nSodium oleoyl isethionate*\nSodium oleyl methyl isethionate*\nSodium palm kerneloyl isethionate*\nSodium stearoyl methyl isethionate**Ingredients in this group not in current use to be used in the\nfuture, the expectation is that they would be used in product\ncategories and at concentrations comparable to others in this\ngroup.\nAuthor Contributions\nC.

The Panel reviewed therelevant data provided and concluded that these ingredients are safe in the present practices of use and concentration describedin this safety assessment.\nKeywords\ntissue proteins, cosmetics, safety\nIntroduction\nThe skin and connective tissue-derived proteins and pep-tides detailed in this report are described in the Interna-\ntional Cosmetic Ingredient Dictionary and Handbook\n(Dictionary ) to function mainly as skin and hair condi-\ntioning agents in cosmetics.\n1This report assesses the safety\nof the following 19 skin and connective tissue-derivedingredients:\nAmmonium Hydrolyzed CollagenAtelocollagenCalcium Hydrolyzed CollagenCollagen\nElastin\nFibronectinGelatinHydrolyzed ActinHydrolyzed CollagenHydrolyzed Collagen ExtractHydrolyzed ElastinHydrolyzed Fibronectin\nHydrolyzed Gelatin\nHydrolyzed ReticulinHydrolyzed SponginMEA-Hydrolyzed CollagenSoluble CollagenSoluble ElastinZinc Hydrolyzed CollagenThe Panel previously reviewed the ingredient Hydrolyzed\nCollagen, and concluded that it is safe for use in cosmetics; the\nreport was published in 1985 and the conclusion was re-\nafﬁrmed in a re-review that was published in 2006.\n2,3This\ningredient was included in this safety assessment because ofthe relevance of the information in regards to reviewing thesafety of the other ingredients in the report.\nAdditionally, the safety of several other hydrolyzed pro-\nteins as used in cosmetics has been reviewed by the Panel inseveral previous assessments. The Panel concluded that\nHydrolyzed Keratin ( ﬁnalized in 2016), Hydrolyzed Soy\nProtein ( ﬁnalized in 2015), Hydrolyzed Silk ( ﬁnalized in\n2015), Hydrolyzed Rice Protein (published in 2006), andHydrolyzed Corn Protein (published in 2011) are safe for usein cosmetics.\n4-8The Panel concluded that Hydrolyzed Wheat\nGluten and Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein are safe for use incosmetics when formulated to restrict peptides to a weight-average MW of 3500 Da or less.\n9The Panel concurrently\n*Cosmetic Ingredient Review Senior Scienti ﬁc Analyst/Writer\n**Expert Panel for Cosmetic Ingredient Safety Member***Former Expert Panel for Cosmetic Ingredient Safety Member\n†Cosmetic Ingredient Review Executive Director\nCorresponding Author:\nBart Heldreth, Cosmetic Ingredient Review, 1620 L Street, NW, Suite 1200,Washington, DC 20036.\nEmail: cirinfo@cir-safety.orgreviewed the safety of plant-derived and bovine milk-derived\nproteins, which had, at that time, tentative conclusions of safeas used, in separate reports. In addition to the review of theseother protein-derived ingredients, the Panel has assessed thesafety of Ethanolamine (also known as monoethanolamine orMEA) and Ethanolamine Salts and concluded these ingredi-\nents are safe when formulated to be nonirritating (rinse-off\nproducts only) but should not be used in cosmetic products inwhich N-nitroso compounds may be formed.\n10\nActin, Collagen, Elastin, Fibronectin, Gelatin, and reticulin\nall are derived from essential components in animal tissues.Much of the available published literature evaluated the effectsof pharmaceutical or other agents on these proteins in theirnaturally occurring tissues. These studies were not considered\nrelevant for assessing the safety of the skin and connective\ntissue-derived ingredients as used in cosmetics and are notincluded in this assessment.\nThe sources for these cosmetic ingredients may be from\nmany different land or marine animals. These differingsources could potentially produce or result in skin and con-nective tissue-derived proteins with unique properties, whichmay result in varying compositions and impurities within a\nsingle ingredient (eg, Hydrolyzed Collagen from animals such\nas cows may have some impurities that are different fromHydrolyzed Collagen obtained from ﬁsh).\nThis safety assessment includes relevant published and\nunpublished data that are available for each endpoint that isevaluated. Published data are identi ﬁed by conducting an\nexhaustive search of the world ’s literature. A listing of the\nsearch engines and websites that are used and the sources\nthat are typically explored, as well as the endpoints that\nPanel typically evaluates, is provided on the CosmeticIngredient Review (CIR) website (https://www.cir-safety.org/supplementaldoc/preliminary-s earch-engines-and-websites;\nhttps://www.cir-safety.org/supplementaldoc/cir-report-format-outline). Unpublished data are provided by the cosmetics in-dustry, as well as by other interested parties.\nChemistry\nDeﬁnition\nThe de ﬁnitions and functions of the skin and connective\ntissue-derived proteins and peptides, as provided in theDictionary , are described in Table 1. General and more\nspeciﬁc descriptions of these ingredients are found below and\nin sub-sections, respectively.\nSkin and connective tissue pro tein derivatives form a broad\ncategory of materials that are prepared by extraction from animaltissue and partial hydrolysis to yield cosmetic ingredients.\nProteins and protein hydrolysates, including those of animaltissue, are used as conditioning ag ents in hair and skin products.\nThese proteins are present in man y types of tissue, including skin.\nThe most abundant protein in mammals is collagen,\nmaking up approximately 30% of all proteins by mass.\n11,12The collagen family is comprised of 28 members (named\ncollagen I to collagen XXVIII) that all have at least 1 triplehelix in their structure at varying degrees (see further de-scription below).\n12The most common are mainly the ﬁbril-\nforming collagens (types I, II, III, and V) that are found in skin,cartilage, reticulate, and cell surfaces. Most of the other\nproteins addressed in this report are derivatives of collagen,\nare co-located with collagen in tissues, or are both. Gelatin, forexample, is a product obtained by the partial hydrolysis ofcollagen derived from the skin, white connective tissue, andbones of animals.\n11Reticulin is a type of ﬁber in connective\ntissue composed of type III collagen secreted by reticular cells.Actin, elastin, and ﬁbronectin are discrete in structure from\ncollagens, but are commonly co-located with collagen in\ntissue (eg, ﬁbronectin commonly provides rigidity on the\nedges of primarily collagen-based tissues). Spongin, however,is a collagen-like protein found only in marine sponges(constituting the small skeletal elements, or spicules, in theanimal).\nThe preparation of protein hydrolysates can be accom-\nplished via acid, enzyme, or other methodologies. Thesemethodologies, and the degree to which they are utilized, may\nprofoundly affect the size and biological activity of such\nhydrolysates. In most ingredients in this report, even in in-gredients without “hydrolyzed ”in the name, the proteins are at\nleast hydrolyzed to some degree as a necessary part of ex-traction or solubilization. Further steps towards solubilizationof these macromolecules are commonly achieved via reactionwith an alkaline substance to generate a protein salt (eg,Calcium Hydrolyzed Collagen).\nActin. Actin is a major protein of muscle and an important\ncomponent of all eukaryotic cells.\n11α-Actin is found in dif-\nferentiated muscle cells, while β-actin and γ-actin are in all\nnon-muscle cell types.\nCollagen\nCollagen is the main constituent of skin (comprising 70% to80% dry weight of the dermis) and connective tissue, and isthe organic substance of bones and teeth.\n11,13Collagen is\nprimarily responsible for the skin ’s tensile strength. One\nCollagen molecule consists of 3 polypeptide chains, eachcontaining approximately 1000 amino acids in a primarysequence that is rich in proline, hydroxyproline, and hy-droxylysine. Collagen is not just 1 discrete, ubiquitous protein\nsequence, but is a protein superfamily that is diversi ﬁed across\ndifferent tissue/function types and source species, includingcattle, chicken, and ﬁsh.\n12,14The common structural feature of\ncollagen proteins is the presence of a triple helix. However, thepercentage of each protein that this helix makes up can varyacross different members of the collagen superfamily from aslittle as 10% to nearly 100%. The diversity of the Collagensuperfamily is further increased by the presence or absence of\nseveral α-chains, the existence of several molecular isoforms22S International Journal of Toxicology 41(Supplement 2)Table 1.

There are 2 types of elastin: Type 1 is derived frombovine neck ligaments, aorta (as reported in 1987), skin, andrelated tissues; Type 2 is derive d from cartilage and its deriva-\ntives.\n15In skin, Elastin is the intact elastic ﬁber network that\ncomprises approximately 2% to 4% of the dermis by volume.13\nFibronectin\nFibronectin is a multifunctional glycoprotein found on cellsurfaces, in body ﬂuids (especially plasma), in soft connective\ntissue matrices, and in most basement membranes.\n11\nGelatin\nGelatin is a heterogeneous mixture of water-soluble proteinsof high average molecular weight that are derived from thedenaturation and hydrolysis of Collagen.\n11Glycine or alanine\naccounts for 1 third to 1 half of the amino acid residues, whileanother quarter is composed of proline or hydroxyproline.\nReticulin\nReticulin is a connective tissue protein that occurs whereverconnective tissue forms a boundary\n11\nPhysical and Chemical Properties\nThe molecular weight (MW) ranges for some of the skin andconnective tissue-derived proteins and peptides are presented\nin Table 2.\nCollagen\nSolutions of Collagen for cosmetic use have a pH range of 3.8\nto 4.714Hydrolyzed Collagen\nHydrolyzed Collagen may be a powder or solution.2A 10%\naqueous solution has a pH of 4.0-6.5.\nElastin\nPuriﬁed Elastin is a pale yellow color and exhibits a bluish\nﬂuorescence in UV light.11It resists acid and alkaline hydrolysis.\nIt is practically insoluble even in hydrogen-bond-breaking sol-vents at temperatures up to 100°C, and is nearly impossible tobring into solution except by using reagents capable of hydro-lyzing peptide bonds. Unprocessed or native elastin is reported to\nbe too insoluble for use in cosmetic formulations.\n15\nFibronectin\nFibronectin can be provided in a solution or as a lyophilized\npowder.19\nGelatin\nGelatin is a vitreous, brittle solid that is colorless to faintlyyellow.\n11,20It is practically odorless and tasteless. When Gelatin\ngranules are immersed in cold water, they hydrate into discrete,swollen particles. When warmed, Gelatin disperses into water.Warm-blooded animal sourced Gelatin has a gel point of 30 to35°C, while cold-water ocean ﬁsh sourced Gelatin has a gel point\nbetween 5 and 10°C. Gelatin is so luble in aqueous solution of\npolyhydric alcohols like glycerin and acetic acid and is insoluble\nin alcohol, chloroform, ether, and most other organic solvents.\nSoluble Elastin\nSoluble Elastin is reported to be a cream-colored powder thatis soluble in water and ethanol.\n15\nMethod of Manufacturing\nMethods used to manufacture protein hydrolysates typicallyyield broad MW distributions of peptides, ranging from 500 to30 000 daltons (Da), equating to 4 to 220 amino acids inlength.\n21,22Treatment with certain enzymes, such as papain,\ncan routinely yield narrower distributions of 500 to 10 000 Da,Table 2.

Use frequencies of individual ingredients in cos-metics are collected from manuf acturers and reported by\ncosmetic product category in the FDA Voluntary Cosmetic\nRegistration Program (VCRP) database. Use concentrationdata are submitted by Industry in response to surveys,conducted by the Personal Care Products Council (Coun-cil), of maximum reported use concentrations by productcategory.\nAccording to 2017 VCRP data, the ingredients with the\ngreatest number of uses are Hydrolyzed Collagen (543 for-mulations) and Soluble Collagen (425 formulations); the\nmajority of uses are in leave-on skin care products (Table 5\nand Table 6).\n42Gelatin is used in a total of 334 formulations;\nthe majority of the uses are in rinse-off bath soaps anddetergents. The results of the concentration of use surveyconducted in 2016 by the Council indicate Collagen hasthe highest reported maximum concentration of use; it isused at up to 96% in face and neck skin care products.\n43\nGelatin is used at up to 66% i n bath oils, tablets, and\nsalts. The other in-use ingred ients are used at much lower\nconcentrations.\nHistoric and current use data for Hydrolyzed Collagen is\nreported in Table 6. The number of uses of HydrolyzedCollagen has declined since the i nitial safety assessment in 1981\nand the re-review in 2002 (923 and 570 uses, respectively\n2,3).\nThe maximum use concentration of Hydrolyzed Collagen wasreported to be 16.5% in hair tonics and dressings in 2016; itwas previously reported to be used at concentrations greater\nthan 50% (in rinse-off formulations).\n2,43\nIngredients with no reported uses in the VCRP or by\nCouncil are listed in Table 7.\nIn some cases, reports of uses were received from the VCRP,\nbut no concentration of use data were provided. For example,Elastin is reported to be used in 46 formulations, but no useconcentration data were provided. In other cases, no uses werereported to the VCRP, but a maximum use concentration wasprovided in the industry survey. For example, AmmoniumHydrolyzed Collagen was not reported in the VCRP database tobe in use, but the industry survey indicated that it is used in\nseveral formulations at concentrations up to 0.12%.\nS o m eo ft h e s ei n g r e d i e n t sm a yb eu s e di np r o d u c t st h a t\ncan come into contact with mucous membranes and theeyes.

An allergen must have at least 2 IgE-binding epitopes,\nand each epitope must be at least 15 amino-acid residues long,to trigger a Type 1 hypersensitivity reaction.\n56Type 1 re-\nsponses can be elicited in sensitized patients when pairs of IgE\nmolecules against a speci ﬁc allergen are bound to receptors on\nthe surface of mast cells and other cells that mediate immunereactions. The binding of an allergen molecule to 2 receptor-bound IgE molecules results in the crosslinking of the pair ofIgE molecules. The crosslinking of suf ﬁcient numbers of IgE\npairs bound to the receptors on the surface of a mast cell resultsin degranulation of the mast cell and the release of vasoactiveamines, which are responsible for the Type 1 reaction. For\nsome hydrolyzed proteins, the minimum number of amino\nacids (or weight-average MW) to elicit Type 1 hypersensi-tivity has been demonstrated with experimental data. Forexample, studies on hydrolyzed wheat protein show thathydrolysates with MWs less than 3500 Da do not have theproperties required to induce Type 1 hypersensitivity.\n9Con-\nclusive studies that detail the number of amino acids needed totrigger mast cell degranulation for hydrolyzed ﬁsh proteins,\nhowever, were not identi ﬁed.\nSkin prick tests and histamine release tests of ﬁsh Gelatin\nand cod ﬁsh were completed in 30 ﬁsh-allergic patients (di-\nagnosed in accordance with European Academy of Allergyand Clinical Immunology Guidelines).\n57Codﬁsh-speci ﬁc IgE\nwas also measured in the patients and they underwent double-blinded, placebo-controlled food challenges with ﬁsh Gelatin.\nTheﬁsh Gelatin used for the study was made through acid\nextraction of cod ﬁsh skins and had an average molecular\nweight of 60 000 Da. All 30 patients had positive skin prick\ntests, histamine release tests, and speci ﬁc IgE to cod ﬁsh. Skin\nprick tests and histamine release tests with ﬁsh Gelatin were\npositive in 3/30 and 7/30 patients, respectively. Oral challengeresulted in 2 patients reporting mild subjective reactions. Onepatient had a mild reaction to the placebo but not the ﬁsh\nGelatin. The proportion of truly sensitive patients was esti-mated to be 0.03. The study authors concluded that the ﬁsh\nGelatin in the study presented no risk to ﬁsh-allergic patients at\ndoses typically used in foods (3.61 g).\nThe potential for tuna skin-derived Gelatin to induce al-\nlergic reaction in patients with ﬁsh allergy or sensitization was\ninvestigated using the serum samples of 100 consecutiveallergic patients.\n58Serum IgE antibodies were tested against\nGelatin and Hydrolyzed Gelatin extracted from yellow ﬁn tuna\nskin and compared to extracts of yellow ﬁn tuna ﬂesh and skin\nand bovine or porcine gelatins. Of the 100 samples tested, only\n3 exhibited reactivity to tuna skin-derived Gelatin (1 hydro-\nlyzed, 2 non-hydrolyzed). No cross-reactivity was observedbetween bovine/porcine Gelatin and ﬁsh Gelatin.Dermal Irritation and Sensitization Studies\nIrritation\nDermal irritation studies are presented in Table 8.27,59-68No\nirritation was predicted in in vitro studies of HydrolyzedCollagen (bovine sourced; up to 55%), Soluble Collagen ( ﬁsh\nand bovine sourced; undiluted), and Hydrolyzed Elastin ( ﬁsh\nand bovine sourced; undiluted). No irritation was observed inrabbits or guinea pigs treated with Hydrolyzed Collagen ( ﬁsh\nsourced; 30% solution) and Hydrolyzed Elastin (source not\nreported; tested neat). Hydrolyzed Collagen (bovine, swine,andﬁsh sourced) was not irritating in human studies at\nconcentration up to 50% in water solution.\nAnimal\nHydrolyzed collagen. Primary skin irritation tests in rabbits\nindicated that Hydrolyzed Collagen was nonirritating orminimally irritating when tested at up to 100%.\n2\nHuman\nHydrolyzed collagen. Irritation was not observed in human\nvolunteers with healthy skin at concentrations up to 28%, butmoderate irritation was observed in volunteers withdermatitis.\n2\nSensitization\nAnimal\nHydrolyzed collagen. Hydrolyzed Collagen was non-\nsensitizing in guinea pig studies at up to 2%.2\nHydrolyzed Collagen (30% solution in water; ﬁsh scale\nsourced; MW ∼400 Da) was considered to be non-sensitizing\nin a guinea pig maximization test using 15 Hartley guinea pigsand performed in accordance to OECD TG 406.\n27The animals\nreceived 7.5% active ingredient intradermally with Freund ’s\ncomplete adjuvant during the ﬁrst induction, while undiluted\ntest material was applied to clipped dorsal skin under oc-clusive 48 h patch during the second induction. The animalswere challenged with undiluted test material on clipped ﬂank\nskin under occlusive 24 h patch. No reactions were observedin any animal 24 h and 48 h post-challenge patching.\nHuman\nHydrolyzed collagen. Formulations containing 0.5% to 28%\nHydrolyzed Collagen produced some irritation but no sensi-tization in human repeated insult patch tests (HRIPTs).\n2\nIn a HRIPT with 50 subjects, Hydrolyzed Collagen (20%\nsolution in water; ﬁsh scale sourced; MW ∼400 Da) was not\nsensitizing.27The test material (0.2 mL) was applied to in-\nfrascapular skin with occlusive patches.\nA study of sensitization to protein hydrolysates in hair care\nproducts was performed in 3 groups of patients.69Theﬁrst\ngroup, which comprised 11 hairdressers with hand dermatitis,submitted to scratch and prick tests with 22 trademarkedBurnett et al. 37Sprotein hydrolysates, including Soluble Collagen and Hy-\ndrolyzed Collagen, as well as quaternized hydrolyzed pro-teins. The second test group comprised 1260 consecutiveadults with suspected allergic respiratory disease; they weresubjected to skin prick tests with 1 to 3 of the protein hy-drolysates. The third group of patients comprised 28 adults\nwith atopic dermatitis and was also tested with a protein\nhydrolysate via a skin prick test.\nPositive reactions were seen in a total of 12 patients (all\nfemale with atopic dermatitis) from 3 of the 22 protein hy-drolysates. All 12 had reactions to hydroxypropyl trimoniumhydrolyzed collagen. Three of the 12 also had a reaction to 1trademarked version of Hydrolyzed Collagen (1% solution),while 1 other had a reaction to hydroxypropyl trimonium\nhydrolyzed milk protein.\n69\nHydrolyzed Elastin\nIn an HRIPT with 52 subjects, Hydrolyzed Elastin (25% w/v\nin corn oil; MW = 3000 Da) did not produce dermal irritationor dermal sensitization.\n70The test patches were occlusive.\nPhototoxicity\nHydrolyzed collagen. Hydrolyzed Collagen at up to 2% was not\nphototoxic to guinea pigs and rabbits, nor was it phototoxic orphotosensitizing to humans at up to 0.5%.\n2UV-induced er-\nythema was decreased after application of 10% solution ofHydrolyzed Collagen (MW = 1500 Da) onto the skin afterirradiation.\nOcular Irritation Studies\nOcular irritation studies are presented in Table 9.27,59-68\nHydrolyzed Collagen ( ﬁsh and bovine sourced; up to 55%),\nSoluble Collagen ( ﬁsh and bovine sourced; undiluted), and\nHydrolyzed Elastin ( ﬁsh and bovine sourced; undiluted) were\npredicted to be minimally or non-irritating in in vitro studies.\nHydrolyzed Collagen ( ﬁsh, swine, and bovine sourced; up to\n30%) and Hydrolyzed Elastin (source not reported; testedneat) were not irritating in rabbit studies.\nAnimal\nHydrolyzed collagen.

A 26-yr-old woman with a history of ﬁsh allergy\nexperienced urticarial eruptions following use of a cosmeticcream containing cod ﬁsh-derived Elastin.\n71The patient ’s\nserum total IgE level was 442 kU/l, and strongradioallergosorbent test (RAST) scores for speci ﬁc IgE were\nobserved for tuna, salmon, mackerel, ﬂatﬁsh, cod ﬁsh,\nhorsemackerel, sardine, and salmon roe. No prick-tests wereperformed because of the patient ’s history of severe symp-\ntoms. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the patient had IgEantibodies against cod ﬁsh Elastin, parvalbumin, Collagen, and\ntransferrin. The molecular weight range of the proteins that the\npatient ’s serum reacted with was 10 000 to 20 000 Da, which\ncorresponded to the range of cod ﬁsh Elastin. The company\nthat produced the cosmetic cream reported that the Elastin inthe cosmetic cream was derived from the skin and soft tissueof cod ﬁsh.\nAtelocollagen and hydrolyzed collagen. A 30-yr-old woman with\na history of atopic dermatitis experienced anaphylaxis twice\non separate occasions, once after consuming a forti ﬁed yogurt\ncontaining ﬁsh-sourced Hydrolyzed Collagen and once after\nconsuming a gummy candy containing ﬁsh-sourced Hydro-\nlyzed Collagen.\n72Fifteen months prior to the anaphylactic\nepisodes, the patient had been applying a moisturizer con-taining Atelocollagen derived from ﬁsh to her impaired facial\nskin. The Atelocollagen in the product has a molecular weight\nof 350 000 Da. Skin prick tests on the patient were positive for\nﬁsh-sourced Hydrolyzed Collagen in the food products, the\nmoisturizer, Atelocollagen, and ﬁsh Gelatin. The tests were\nnegative for Gelatin derived from porcine skin or bovine bone.The patient denied anaphylactic reactions following ingestionof raw or cooked ﬁsh. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide\ngel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and IgE western blot ana-lyses showed that the patient ’s serum reacted with an ap-\nproximately 140 000 Da protein of Atelocollagen and a\n120 000 Da protein of Gelatin from ﬁsh Collagen. Weak re-\nactions were observed with bovine bone Gelatin protein andno reactions were observed to porcine skin Gelatin protein orﬁsh-sourced Hydrolyzed Collagen protein. The researchers of\nthis case study speculated that the Atelocollagen (350 000 Da)was degraded on the skin surface by proteases into smallerpeptides and induced sensitization, but did not rule out the\npossibility that intact Collagen or degradation products with\ngreater than 4500 Da were antigens because of the patient ’s\nimpaired skin.\nHydrolyzed collagen. A 22-yr-old female reported contact ur-\nticaria following use of a hair conditioner that containedsteartrimonium hydrolyzed animal protein.\n73She had a\nsimilar, less severe reaction the year before to another hair\nconditioner that also contained this ingredient. The patient\nalso had a history of hay fever and recurrent hand dermatitis.Prick testing elicited strongly positive wheal and ﬂare re-\nsponse to both hair conditioners, steartrimonium hydrolyzedanimal protein, and other hair conditioners that containedprotein, including Hydrolyzed Collagen in some products.Negative reactions were observed when the patient was testedwith protein-free hair products. Prick tests with the standard\nseries of allergens yielded positive results for grass mix, rye,38S International Journal of Toxicology 41(Supplement 2)English plantain, dust mite, cow ’s milk, soybean, baker ’s\nyeast, and wholegrain wheat. Tests with raw meat werenegative. The patient ’s total IgE was 221 kU/l. RASTs were\nnegative to pork, beef, chicken, and mutton.\nSummary\nThis report assesses the safety of 19 skin and connectivetissue-derived ingredients, including Hydrolyzed Collagen,which has been previously reviewed by the Panel. Summaryinformation presented in this safety assessment from theprevious report is not repeated below.\nIngredients with the greatest number of reported uses in\n2017 are Hydrolyzed Collagen (543 formulations) and Sol-\nuble Collagen (425 formulations); the majority of uses are in\nleave-on skin care products. Gelatin is used in a total of 334formulations; the majority of the uses are in rinse-off bathsoaps and detergents. The results of the concentration of usesurvey conducted in 2016 by the Council indicate Collagenhas the highest reported maximum concentration of use; it isused at up to 96% in face and neck skin care products. Gelatinis used at up to 66% in bath oils, tablets, and salts. The other\nin-use ingredients are used at much lower concentrations.\nA toxicokinetics study of ﬁsh-derived Gelatin (4000 mg/\nkg) in rats found that Gelatin has a high oral bioavailability.\nA product containing 60% chicken-derived Collagen did\nnot produce acute toxic effects in rats that were given a singleoral dose of 5000 mg/kg.\nNo adverse effects were reported in a 2 wk oral study of\nshark skin-derived Gelatin in ovariectomized rats that received\nthe test material at up to 40 mg/100 g daily.\nIn subchronic toxicity studies, rats tolerated daily oral\ndosing of a test material containing 60% Collagen. No adverseeffects were reported in a 4-mo study of a dietary supplementcontaining a 250 mL dose of Hydrolyzed Collagen in humanchildren\nGelatin and other skin and connective tissue-derived\nproteins may be sourced from ﬁsh, which is a major food\nallergen that can produce Type 1 hypersensitivity reactions in\nsensitized individuals. Researchers have reported a low risk ofIgE-mediated reactions to ﬁsh Gelatin in individuals with ﬁsh\nallergies.\nNo dermal irritation was predicted based on in vitro studies\nof Hydrolyzed Collagen (bovine sourced; up to 55%), SolubleCollagen ( ﬁsh and bovine sourced; undiluted), and Hydro-\nlyzed Elastin ( ﬁsh and bovine sourced; undiluted). No dermal\nirritation was observed in rabbits or guinea pigs treated with\nHydrolyzed Collagen ( ﬁsh sourced; 30% solution) and Hy-\ndrolyzed Elastin (source not reported; tested neat). Hydro-lyzed Collagen (bovine, swine, and ﬁsh sourced) was not\nirritating in human dermal studies at concentrations up to 50%in water solution.\nA guinea pig maximization test found Hydrolyzed Collagen\n(ﬁsh sourced; 30% solution in water) to be non-sensitizing.\nIn HRIPT studies, Hydrolyzed Elastin (25% w/v in corn oil)and Hydrolyzed Collagen ( ﬁsh sourced; 20% solution in\nwater) did not produce dermal irritation or dermal sensitiza-tion. Hydrolyzed Collagen produced positive results in skinprick tests of dermatitic patients.\nHydrolyzed Collagen ( ﬁsh and bovine sourced; up to 55%),\nSoluble Collagen ( ﬁsh and bovine sourced; undiluted), and\nHydrolyzed Elastin ( ﬁsh and bovine sourced; undiluted) were\npredicted to be minimally or non-irritating in ocular in vitrostudies. Hydrolyzed Collagen ( ﬁsh, swine, and bovine\nsourced; up to 30%) and Hydrolyzed Elastin (source not re-ported; tested neat) were not irritating in rabbit ocular studies.\nCase reports of dermal sensitization to cosmetics con-\ntaining Elastin, Atelocollagen, and Collagen derived from ﬁsh\nhave been described in the published literature. Reactions to\nHydrolyzed Collagen have been reported as well.\nNo relevant published DART or carcinogenicity studies on\nskin and connective tissue-derived proteins and peptides wereidenti ﬁed in a literature search for these ingredients, and no\nunpublished data were submitted.\nDiscussion\nThe Panel noted that there was a lack of systemic toxicity data(ie reproductive and developmental toxicity, genotoxicity, andcarcinogenicity data); however, the Panel was not concernedthat these proteins and peptides would cause adverse systemiceffects in the general population. These proteins and peptides,similar to the other proteins and peptides reviewed by thePanel, are found in food, and daily exposures from theconsumption of food can be expected to yield much larger\nsystemic exposures to these ingredients than those from use in\ncosmetic products. The Panel also found that the earlier as-sessments of Hydrolyzed Collagen supported the safety ofthese ingredients in cosmetic products.\nThe Panel noted that ﬁsh proteins are known food allergens\nthat can elicit Type 1 immediate hypersensitivity reactionswhen ingested by sensitized individuals. The Panel expressedconcern that sensitized individuals would not easily recognize\ncosmetic products containing ﬁsh-derived collagen based on\nthe current naming conventions used in the ingredient lists onproduct labels (eg, Collagen and Hydrolyzed Collagen may besourced from ﬁsh, though “ﬁsh”is not in the ingredient name).\nIn the absence of negative Type 1 immediate hypersensitivitydata for ﬁsh-derived protein ingredients (or other information\nsupporting an inability of the supplied ingredient to elicit suchsensitization (eg, a maximum peptide length that is shorter\nthan the minimum IgE-binding epitopes)), the Panel advised\nmanufacturers to label products containing these ﬁsh-derived\ningredients to inform individuals sensitized to ﬁsh proteins.\nThe Panel was also concerned about the inherent risks of\nusing animal-derived ingredients in cosmetic products, namelythe potential for transmission of infectious agents. While Gelatinand Collagen prepared exclusively from hides and skins do nothave the propensity to carry disease, the Panel stressed that these\ningredients must be free of detectible infectious pathogensBurnett et al. 39S(ie, BSE) if these materials are derived from other bovine ma-\nterials. Raw material suppliers and formulators of these ingre-\ndients must assure that these ingredients are free from pathogenicviruses and other infectious agents.\nThe Panel discussed the issue of incidental inhalation\nexposure from hair care products, skin care preparations, face\npowders, and fragrances. There were no inhalation toxicity\ndata available. Although the Panel noted that droplets/particlesfrom spray and loose-powder cosmetic products would not berespirable to any appreciable amount, the potential for inha-lation toxicity is not limited to respirable droplets/particlesdeposited in the lungs. In principle, inhaled droplets/particlesdeposited in the nasopharyngeal and thoracic regions of therespiratory tract may cause toxic effects depending on their\nchemical and other properties. However, coupled with the\nsmall actual exposure in the breathing zone and the con-centrations at which the ingredients are used, the availableinformation indicates that incidental inhalation would not be asigniﬁcant route of exposure that might lead to local respi-\nratory or systemic effects. A detailed discussion and summaryof the Panel ’s approach to evaluating incidental inhalation\nexposures to ingredients in cosmetic products is available at\nhttps://www.cir-safety.org/cir- ﬁndings.\nConclusion\nThe Expert Panel for Cosmetic Ingredient Safety concluded\nthat the 19 skin and connective tissue-derived proteins andpeptides listed below are safe in cosmetics in the presentpractices of use and concentration described in this safety\nassessment.\nAmmonium Hydrolyzed CollagenAtelocollagenCalcium Hydrolyzed Collagen*CollagenElastinFibronectinGelatin\nHydrolyzed Actin\nHydrolyzed CollagenHydrolyzed Collagen Extract*Hydrolyzed ElastinHydrolyzed FibronectinHydrolyzed Gelatin*Hydrolyzed ReticulinHydrolyzed Spongin*\nMEA-Hydrolyzed Collagen\nSoluble CollagenSoluble Elastin*Zinc Hydrolyzed Collagen*\n*Not reported to be in current use.

Ammonium Hydroxide is also reported to \nfunction as a denaturant. The Panel reviewed data relevant to the safety of these ingredients and concluded that Ammonia and \nAmmonium Hydroxide are safe as used in hair dyes and colors and safe in cosmetics applied directly to the skin in the \npresent practices of use and concentration described in the safety assessment , when formulated to be non- irritating.  \nINTRODUCTION  \n The safety of Ammonia and Ammonium Hydroxide in cosmetics is reviewed in this Cosmetic Ingredient Review \n(CIR) safety assessment.  According to the web-based International Cosmetic Ingr edient Dictionary and Handbook  (wINCI \nDictionary ), both ingredients are reported to function as pH adjusters in cosmetic products.1  Additionally, Ammonia is \nreported to function as an external analgesic and fragrance ingredient , and Ammonium Hydroxide is reported to function as a \ndenaturant in cosmetic products.  External analg esic and fragrance are functions the CIR Expert Panel (Panel) may exclude \nfrom their purview  and, therefore, they will not evaluate safety in relation to those uses.     \n \n This safety assessment includes relevant published and unpublished data for each end point that is evaluated.  \nPublished data are identified by conducting an exhaustive search of the world’s literature.  A list of the typical search eng ines \nand websites used, sources explored, and endpoints that CIR evaluates is available on the CIR websit e (http://www.cir -\nsafety.org/supplementaldoc/preliminary -search -engines -and-websites ; http://www.cir -safety.org/supplementaldoc/cir -report -\nformat -outline ).  Unpublished data are provided by the cosmetics industry, as well as by other interested parties.  \n \nAn Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) toxicological r eview that covers gaseous A mmonia (NH 3) and \nAmmonia dissolved in water (Ammonium H ydroxide, NH 4OH) was published in 2016 .2  It should be noted that portions of \nthe EPA review are adapted from the toxicological profile for Ammonia that was developed by the Agency for Toxic \nSubstances and Disease Registry (ATSDR). This CIR safety assessment also includes toxicity data on Ammonia/Ammonium \nHydroxide that have become available since the ATSDR and EPA documents were p ublished.  \n \n In addition to the A TSDR and EPA reports on Ammonia, an expert assessment of the effects on human health and \nthe environment posed by Ammonia, prepared by a 14- member task group, is available.3  This assessment was published \nunder  the joint sponsorship of the United Nations Environment Program, the International Labor Organization, and the World \nHealth Organization.  \n \nFurthermore, i n addition to the safety test data on Ammonia and Ammonium Hydroxide that are included in this \nsafety assessment, the Panel addressed the use of chemicals for read -across, and determined that information reported for the \nfollowing chemicals is appropriate for read -across :  data on “ammonium ion”  (reproductive and developmental toxicity, \ngenotoxicity, and carcinogenicity data ; counter ion not identified ) that are included in the ATSDR  toxicological profile for \nAmmonia ; diammonium phosphate (repeated dose (short -term) oral toxicity and reproductive  and developmental toxicity  \ndata)  that are included in the CIR Final Report on Phosphoric Acid and Its Salts and  in the European Chemicals Agency \n(ECHA) registration dossier on Ammonia ;  and data on ammonium chloride (genotoxicity data [micronucleus test] ) and  \nammonium sulfate (oral carcinogenicity and chronic oral toxic ity data) that are included also included in the ECHA dossier \n(Table 1).4,5,6  \n  \n \nCHEMISTRY  \nDefinition  and General Characterization  \nAmmonia, ammonia gas, anhydrous ammonia, and liquid ammonia are terms that are often used interchangeably to \nrefer to the ingredient, Ammonia, in either its liquid  (compressed)  or gaseous state.7  Ammonia dissolved in water is referred \nto as aqueous ammonia, ammonia solution, and the cosmetic ingredient name, Ammonium Hydroxide. In an aqueous \nformulation, these two ingredients will each consist of at least some of the other , dependent on the effective pH  of the \nformulation .  \n  \n \nFigure 1.  The gas and aqueous solution equilibria of Ammonia and Ammonium Hydroxide  \n  Referring to Figure 1, some ammonia is actually ionized to ammonium ion, with hydroxide anion being formed in \nan equal amount (stoichiometrically) in pure water to produce Ammonium Hydroxide.  \n \nAmmonium Hydroxide is formed simply by the solution of Ammonia  in water . Regardless of whether the ingredient \nis named Ammonia or Ammonium Hydroxide, if the formulation or test article  contains water , both are present in \nequilibrium.  At or near neutral pH, more than 99% is in the form of  ammonium ion, and less than 1% is Ammonia .  In more \nalkaline (i.e. higher pH) solutions, the Ammoni a concentration can be significantly higher (e.g., at pH 9.25 the ratio of \nAmmonia to Ammonium Hydroxide is about 1:1; pK\nb ~4.8 at room temperature ).  Accordingly, th e ratio of dissolved \nmolecular Ammonia versus the ions of Ammonium Hydroxide is mainly dependent  on the pH of the formulation.  Saturation \nin water, at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, is approximately 34%.8 \n   \nSince the function s of fragrance  and external analgesic may be excluded from the purview of the CIR Expert Panel, the only \nfunction of Ammonia under review herein is pH adjuster.  The term “pH” is defined as the negative log 10 of the concentration \nof hydrogen ions (protons), existing as solvated forms, including hydronium ion and higher solvates  in water .  Above pH 7, \nthe concentration of hydroxyl anion (OH-) becomes greater than hydroniu m, increasing as pH becomes more alkaline.  \nAcco rdingly,  pH adjusters function in aqueous formulations and this safety assessment evaluates Ammonia and Amm onium \nHydroxide in that context.  (Ammonium Hydroxide is also reported functions as a denaturant. )  \n \nThe definitions, structures, and functions in cosmetics of these ingredients are presented in Table  2. \n  \nChemical and Physical Properties  \n \nAmmonia is  a small nitrogenous compound with a molecular weight of 17 that is a gas at standard temperature and \npressure.9  It is a weak base that exists in protic equilibrium with Ammonium Hydroxide,  as shown in Figure 1. Solvation of \nammonia in water results in an equilibrium between dissolved ammonia and ammonium, the latter being formed by the abstraction of a proton from one equivalent of water molecules to produce a stoichiometric amount of hydroxyl anions ( i.e., \nan acid -base reaction in essentially instantaneous equilibrium when in free aqueous solution ).  Additional chemical properties \nare p resented in Table 3.\n9,10,11,12 \n \n  \nMethod  of Manufacture  \nAmmonia can be formed from water gas and producer gas via the Haber -Bosch process  (i.e., under high temperature \nand pressure, hydrogen and ni trogen are  combined to produce A mmonia) .8  \n \n Ammonium Hydroxide  can be produced by passing Ammonia gas into water.13  \nComposition  \nAccording to the Food Chemicals Codex , Ammonium Hydroxide contains not l ess than 27% and not more than 30% \nby weight NH 3.14  The monograph on strong Ammonia solution in the United States Pharmacopoeia states that this is a \nsolution of NH 3, containing not less than 27% and not more that 31 % (w/w) NH 3.15  \nImpurities  \nAccording to the Food Chemicals Codex , the acceptance criteria for Ammonium Hydroxide include:  lead (not more \nthan 0.5 mg/kg), n onvolatile residue (not more than 0.02%), and readily oxidizable substances (pink color does not \ncompletely disappear within 10 minutes).14  Similarly, according to the United States P harmacopoeia, the limitat ions on \nstrong Amm onia solution include:  heavy metals (0.0013% limit), nonvolatile residue (not more than 5 mg of residue remains \n[0.05%]), and readily oxidizable substances (pink color does not completely disappear within 10 minutes).15 \n  \nUSE  \nCosmetic  \n \nThe safety of Ammonia and Ammonium Hydroxide is evaluated based on data received from the U.S. Food and \nDrug Administration (FDA) and the cosmetics industry on the expected use of this ingredient in cosmetics.   Use frequencies \nof individual ingredients in cosmetics are collected from manufacturers and reported by cosmetic product category in FDA’s \nVoluntary Cosmetic Registration Program (VCRP) database.16  Use concentration data are submitted by the cosmetics \nindustry in response to surveys,  conducted by the Personal Care Products Council (Council), of maximum reported use \nconcentrations by product category.17 \n \nAccording to 2017 VCRP data, Ammonia is being used in 599 cosmetic products ( mostly rinse -off products ) and \nAmmonium H ydroxide is being used in 1354 cosmetic products (mostly rinse -off products ) (Table 4).16  Most of the uses of \nthese 2 ingredients  are in hair coloring products  (582/599 (97.2%) uses for Ammonia and 1104/1354 (81.5%) uses for \nAmmonium Hydroxide) .  The results of a concentration of use survey provided by the Council in 201 7 indicate that  the \nhighest maximum cosmetic  use concentration of Ammonia is  4.6 % (in hair dyes and colors ) and that the highest maximum \ncosmetic use concentration of Ammoni um Hydroxide is 12.5% (in hair dyes and colors ) (Table 4).17  Regarding use \nconcentrations in leave -on products, the highest maximum cosmetic use concentrations are 0.73% (Ammonia - in tonics, \ndressings, and  other hair grooming aids ) and 1.5% (Ammonium Hydroxide  - in face and neck products [not spray]).   \n \nCosmetic products containing Ammonia or Ammonium Hydroxide may be applied to the skin and hair or, \nincidentally, may come in contact with the eyes (e.g., at maximum use concentrations up to 0.58% (Ammonium Hydroxide  \nin eye  brow pencils ) and mucous  membranes (e.g., at maximum use concentrations up to 0.0012% Ammonium Hydroxide in \nbath soaps and detergents).   Products containing Ammonia or Ammonium Hydroxide may be applied as frequently as several \ntimes per day and may come in contact with the skin or hair for variable periods following application.  Daily or occasional \nuse may extend over many years.  \n \nThe denaturant use of Ammonium Hydroxide is relevant to cosmetic use.  The formula for SD alcohol 36 is:  “To \nevery 100 gallons of strong ammonia  solution, N.F.: 17.5 pounds of caustic soda, liquid grade, containing 50 percent sodium \nhydroxide by weight; or 12.0 pounds of caustic soda, liquid grade, containing 73 percent sodium hydro xide by weight.” \n(27CFR21.63)   This denatured alcohol is permitted  for use in shampoos  and soap and bath preparations.   \n \nAmmonia (CAS No. 7664 -41-7) and Ammonium Hydroxide (CAS No. 1336 -21-6) are  on the European Union’s list \nof substances that cosmetics must not contain, except when subject to the following restriction:  maximum concentration in \nready for use preparation (6% (as NH 3)).18  Furthermore, the following phrase appears in the wording of “conditions of use \nand warnings” category: above 2%: co ntains Ammonia.   \n \nNon-Cosmetic  \nAmmonia is a chemical with d iverse uses, such as fertilizer and as a refrigerant.19  Ammonia is also used in \nproduction of dyes, plastics, synthetic fibers, pesticides, explosives, refrigerants, and pharmaceuticals , and in the purification \nof water .7  27CFR21.63 also permits  (in addition to the cosmetic uses above)  the use of Ammonium Hydroxide as a \ndenaturant in household cleaners.  \n Ammonium Hydroxide is affirmed as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) as a direct human food ingredient. \n[21CFR 184.1139 ]  Ammonium Hydroxide must meet the specifications of the Food Chemicals Codex  (see Impurities \nsection), and,  in accordance with these specifications, the ingredient is used in food with no limitation other than current \ngood manufacturing practice.  Concerning animals, anhydrous Ammonia is a food additive  permitted in feed and drinking \nwater , and it is used or intended for use as a source of non- protein nitrogen in cattle feed . [21CFR573.180 ] \n In Australia, Ammonia and Ammonium Hydroxide are listed in the Poisons Standard , the standard for the uniform \nscheduling of medicines and poisons (SUSMP)  in schedules 5 and 6 .\n20  Under schedule 5, Ammonia and Ammonium \nHydroxide are permit ted in preparations containing ≤ 5% Ammonia, with the following exceptions: in preparations for \nhuman internal therapeutic use ; in preparations for inhalation when absorbed in an inert solid material; or in preparations \ncontaining  ≤   0.5% free Ammonia.  Schedule 5 chemicals are defined as substances with a low potential for causing harm, \nthe extent of which can be reduced  through the use of appropriate packaging with simple warnings and safety directions on \nthe label; schedule 5 chemicals are labeled with “Caution”.   Schedule 6 chemicals are classified as poisons with a moderate \npotential for harm.  \n Ammonia,  as  an intravenous ly-injected prescription drug,  is included on the list of FDA -approved drug products.\n21  \nAmmonia solution has been classified as an over -the-counter (OTC) drug active ingredient as a skin protectant and external \nanalgesic, and the same is true for Ammonium Hydroxide as a skin protectant.  However, FDA has determined that there are \ninadequate data to establish general recognition of the saf ety and effectiveness of these ingredients for the specified uses .22    \n \nTOXICOKINETIC STUDIES  \nBecause of the equilibrium nature of thes e two ingredients, the studies that follow will simply recite “Ammonia” for most \ncases, regardless of whether Ammonia or Ammonium Hydroxide was reported.  \nAbsorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion  \nAmmonia is the principal  by-product of amino acid metabolism, and the liver is indicated as the central organ of \nAmmonia metabolism.23  It is generated , in vivo,  from the breakdown of nitrogenous substances in the gut and from the use \nof glutamine as a metabolic fuel in the small intestine, and is taken up by the liver where it is detoxified by conversion to urea \nand, to a lesser extent, glutamine.24,25 The main source of in vivo Ammonia generation occurs in the intest ines, from lysis of \nblood -borne urea and also from protein digestion/deamination by urease -positive bacteria and microbial deaminase.26,27 A \nlarge amo unt of metabolically -generated A mmonia is absorbed into the blood and, via the portal vein, is transported to  the \nliver wh ere it is detoxified.26,28 ,29  The normal conce ntration of A mmonia in the porta l blood varies from 300 to 600 μM . But, \nin the blood leaving the liver the concentration is reduced to 20 –60 μM.  The liver occupies a central  position in the \nregulation of A mmonia levels in the organism.30,31  According to another source, the normal range for blood serum levels is \n10-40 µmol/L.32 \n \nThe substrates from which Ammonia may be formed in the gut comprise derivatives of ingested nitrogenous \nmaterial, epithelial and ba cterial debris, and compounds secreted from the circulation to the mucosal cells and lumen (e.g., \ncertain peptides, amino acids, and smaller diffusible substances such as urea).33  Both the gut and kidneys generate subs tantial \namounts of Ammonia from the deamidation of glutamine.23   The glutamine -glutamate cycle in the body works in \nconjunction with the glucose -alanine cycle to shuttle Ammonia from peripheral to visceral organs.  \n  \nRenal regulation of acid -base balance involves the formation and excretion of Ammonia  to buffer hydrogen ions that \nare excr eted in the urine.  Approximately two -thirds of urinary Ammonia is derived from the amide nitrogen of glutamine, a \nreaction that is catalyzed by the glutaminase enzyme in renal tubular cells.23 \n The first step in the degradation of  most amino acids is the removal of an α -amino residue, and an amino residue is \ntransferred to α -ketoglutari c acid to produce glutamate.\n34  Glutamate dehydrogenase converts glutamate to α - ketoglutarate \nand A mmonia.   To prevent a toxic buildup  of Ammonia, it is converted to glutamine and alanine in a number of tissues for \ntransportation to the liver .  Ammonia is then converted to urea via the urea cycle in the liver, and urea is excreted in the urine.  \nThe urea cycle, a cycle of biochemical reactions that produces urea from A mmonia, is the major pathway for A mmonia \ndetoxification in terrestrial mammals.35  In the liver, the urea cycle is essential to the conversion of ex cess nitrogen from \nAmmonia and aspartate into urea.36  When the supply of Ammonia in mammals exceeds the capacity for its detoxification, \nthe excretion of orotic acid in the urine increases.35  Orotic acid (from the urea cycle) is an intermediate product in the \nbiosynthesis of pyrimidines  and purines . \n \nThere is evidence that Ammonia can cross the blood -brain barrier (BBB) , mostly through ion transporters rather \nthan by passive diffusion  of gaseous Ammonia .26,37 \n Animal  \nInhalation  \n \nBrain glutamine levels have been shown to increase in rats that inhaled 25 or 300 ppm A mmonia  vapor for 6 \nhours/day for 5 days, which is likely a result of Ammonia metabolism by the astrocytic  glutamate -glutamine cycle .38,39 \n \nContinuous exposure of rats for 24 h to concentrations up to 32 ppm Amm onia resulted in significant increase in  \nblood A mmonia levels.40   Exposures to 310 - 1157 ppm led to significantly increased blood concentrations of Ammonia \nwithin 8 h  of exp osure initiati on, but blood Ammonia returned to pre-exposure values within 12 hours of continuous \nexposure and did not change over the rem ainder  of the  24-hour exposure period . \n \nParenteral  \n \nFollowing the administration of [13N]Ammonia to rats (via either the carotid artery or cerebrospinal fluid ), most \nmetabolized label led nitrogen  was in glutamine (amide) , and little was in glutamate (plus aspartate).41 \n \nTOXI COLOGICAL STUDIES  \nAcute  Toxicity Studies  \nDermal  \n \n Acute dermal toxicity studies on Ammonia were not found in the published literature, nor were these data submitted.  \n \nAcute oral toxicity studies  summarized below are presented in Table  5, and acute inhalation studies  are summarized \nbelow and presented  in Table 6.   \n \nOral  \n \nIn a study in which groups of 6 rats were dosed orally with Ammonium Hydroxide at concentrations ranging from \n0.03% to 1%, the minimum concentration at which gastric lesions were observed was 0.03%;  the ulcer index increased in a \nconcentration -dependent manner.42  An acute oral LD 50 of 350 mg/kg for Ammonia in rats (groups of 10) has been \nreported,6,43,44 and the oral administration of 1 % o r 3% (w/w as Ammonium Hydroxide) to groups of 4 to 8 rats by gavage \nhas produced severe hemorrhagic lesions  of the stomach .45 \n Inhalation  \n \n In a 10-minute exposure study  involving mice  exposed to Ammonia at concentrations ranging from 8723 to 12,870 \nppm, an LC\n50 of 10,096 ppm was reported.24,46  An LC 50 of 10,150 ppm was reported in another 10- minute exposure study in \nwhich mice were exposed to Ammonia at concentrations ranging from 8770 to 12,940 ppm.47,46,48  In mice  exposed to \nAmmonia (100 -800 ppm ) for 30 minutes, an  RD 50 (exposure concentration that produced a 50% reduction in respiratory rate) \nof 303 ppm was reported.24,49,48  The following effects were observed in mice that we re exposed to Ammonia at a \nconcentration of 21,400 ppm  for 30 minutes:  eye irritation, dyspnea, histopathological changes in the lungs (alveolar \ndisruption and loss of septal continuity ), coma, and death.24,50  The following results were observed in mice that were exposed \nto Ammonia for 1 h at vario us concentrations:  nasal/eye irritation, liver congestion, and LC 50 = 4837 ppm (concentration \nrange: 3600 to 5720 ppm); 24,51,48 mild to moderate pneumonitis, hepatic lesio ns, and LC 50 = 4230 ppm (concentration range: \n1190 to 4860 ppm); 24,52,48 eye irritation and alveolar disruption (at 4840 ppm); 24,53 and liver necrosis (at 3440 ppm).52 \n     \n \n In acute inhalation toxicity studies involving rats, LC 50s ranging from 7068 ppm54 to 40,300 ppm55 and RD 50s of \n1396 ppm and 1299 ppm24,56 have been reported.   Exposure durations included 10 minutes ( 14,170 to 54,289 ppm; LC 50 =  \n40,300 ppm),55 20 minutes ( 14,170 to 54,289 ppm; LC 50 =  28,595 ppm );55  40 minutes ( 14,170 to 54,289 ppm; LC 50 =  20,300 \nppm),55  1 h (14,170 to 54,289 ppm; LC 50 =16,600 ppm) ,55  1 h (3028 -14,044 ppm ; LC 50 = 17, 633 ppm),54 and 4 h ( 3028 -\n14,044 ppm ; LC 50 = 7068 ppm).54  Signs of  upper respiratory  tract irritation were observed w ithin the following \nconcentration ranges:  14,170 to 54,289 ppm;55  9000 to 35,000 ppm  (LC 50 = 23,672 ppm) ;57 9,000 to 23,000 ppm;58  3028 to \n14,044 ppm;54  and 1436, 4307, and 6814 ppm.59  No effects were observed at a concentration of 144 ppm.60  Increa sed \nproduction of respiratory tract fluid was observed in rabbits after a 1 -h exposure to Ammonia at the following concentrations:  \n5200 to 12,800 ppm;24 average concentration of 10,360 ppm;24 and at 3.5 and 8.7 ppm.61  A significant decrease in respiratory \nrate was observed in rabbits exposed to Ammonia (50 and 100 ppm) for 2.5 to 3 h.62  Congestion of the respiratory tract /lungs \nwas reported in cat s exposed to 1000 ppm Ammonia for 10 minutes63,64 and, for 1 h,  to 5200 ppm to 12,800 ppm \nAmmonia ,47,65 an average concentration of 10,360 ppm,47,65 and 3.5 and 8.7 ppm .66  Gross pathological findings in the respiratory tract after the 10 -minute exposure included varying degrees of congestion, hemorrhage, edema, interstitial \nemphysema, and lung collapse.  \n \n It has been noted that acute exposure data have demonstrated that injury to respiratory tissues is primarily due to \nAmmonia’s alkaline  (i.e., caustic) properties, resulting from the formation of hydroxide when Ammonia reacts with water.2  \nFurthermore, Ammonia readily dissolves in the moisture on mucous membranes, forming Ammonium Hydroxide, which \ncauses liquefactive necrosis of the tissues.  \n \nShort -Term Toxicity Studies  \nAnimal  \nDermal  \n \nShort- term dermal toxicity data on Ammonium Hydroxide or Ammonia were not found in the published literature, \nnor were these data submitted.  \n \nShort- term oral and inhalation toxicity studies are summarized below and presented in Table 7.   \nOral  \n \n Mucosal atrophy in the stomach antrum and enlargement of the proliferative zone in the mucosa of the stomach \nantrum and body were observed in rats that received 0.01% Ammonium Hydroxide (in drinking water) for 8 weeks.67  A no -\nobserved -adverse effect -level (NOAEL) of 250 mg/kg/day for general toxicity and a lowest -observed- adverse effect -level \n(LOAEL) of 750 mg/kg/day for general toxicity were reported for diammonium phosphate (identified as an appropriate read \nacross mater ial for short -term oral toxicity and included herein to support the overall weight of evidence) in rats dosed orally \n(by gavage) for 5 weeks .6,48 \n \nInhalation  \n \nRhinitis and pathological lesions with metaplasia and necrosis wee observed in mice exposed to Ammonia for 14 \ndays at a concentration of 711 ppm, but not at concentrations of 78 and 271 ppm.24,68  Histopathologic findings  (nasal cavity) \nfor mice exposed to Ammonia (303 ppm) repeatedly for 5 days included slight squamous metaplasia, ulceration, necrosis, \nand moderate inflammatory changes.24,69   Lung congestion and edema were observed in mice exposed to Ammonia (20 ppm) \nfor 42 days.  2,70 A low incidence of carcinoma of the nasal mucosa was observed in mice exposed to Ammonia (12% \nsolution) for 8 weeks, and these results are summarized in more detail in the Carcinogenicity section.2,71  Rats were exposed \nrepeatedly to Ammonia at concentrations ranging from 10 or 150 ppm (for 75 days)2,48,72 to 1306 ppm (for 42 days (5 days/ \nweek and 8 h/day)).73  The higher concentration was tolerated for 42 days in rats, and increased thickness of the nasal \nepithelium was observed at 150 ppm, but not 10 ppm.  Nasal irritation and inflammation of the upper respiratory tract were \nobserved in rats exposed to500 ppm Ammonia for 3 weeks; reactions had cleared by week 8 .48,74   \n \n When rats, rabbits, guinea pigs, monkeys, and dogs were exposed to Ammonia at a concentration of ~ 223 ppm or \n~ 1105 ppm for 6 weeks (5 days/week and 8 h/day), the following effects  were observed:  focal pneumonitis in 1 of 3 \nmonkeys at 223 ppm;  nonspecific lung inflammation in guinea pigs and rats, but not other species at 1105 ppm; and mild to \nmoderate dyspnea in rabbits and dogs during week 1 only at 1105 ppm.2,40, 73  Upper respiratory effects (e.g., dyspnea and \nnasal lesions, irritation, and inflammation) were observed over most of the range of concentra tions tested (145 ppm (5 -week \nexposure )2,75 to 1306 ppm (42- day exposure  (5 days/week and 8 h/day))73 in short -term inhalation to xicity studies on \nAmmonia involving mice, rats, guinea pigs, pigs, rabbits or dogs.  At lower Ammonia concentrations, there were no \ntreatment -related effects in rats (at 50 or 90 ppm (continuous exposure for 50 days))48,76 and  there was no increase in the \nincidence of respiratory diseases in pigs exposed to Ammonia (37 ppm or ~ 14.2 ppm, inhalable dust exposure) for 5 \nweeks.2,77  In other studies, nearly 64% lethality was reported for rats e xposed to Ammonia (653 ppm) for 25 days \n(continuous exposure)9 and 50 of 51 rats exposed to Ammonia (650 ppm) were dead by day 65 of continuous exposure.46,73  \nIn a study in which pigs w ere exposed to Ammonia (5 to 100 ppm) for 6 days, nasal irritation was observed at concentrations \ndown to 25 ppm.78  \n \nSubchronic  Toxicity Studies  \n \nNeither s ubchronic dermal nor oral toxicity data on Ammonium Hydroxide or Ammonia were found in the \npublished literature, nor were these data submitted.  \n Inhalation  \n \nSubchronic inhalation toxicity studies on Ammonia and Ammonium Hydroxide are summarized below and \npresented in Table 7. \n \nFatty changes of liver plate  cells were seen in rats following continuous exposure  to Ammonia (642 ppm) for 90 \ndays.9  The following results were reported for guinea pigs exposed to ~ 170 ppm Ammonia for 18 weeks: mild congestion of \nthe liver, spleen, and kidneys; degenerative changes in the adrenal glands; hemosiderosis in the spleen; and cloudy swelling \nin proximal kidney tubules.47,81  Damaged tracheal mucosae were observed in rats exposed repeated ly to Ammonia ( 100 ppm )  \nfor 12 weeks.47,82  Mild leu kocytosis was noted in rats after exposure to 143 ppm, but not 43 ppm, Ammonia repeatedly (25- \nor 60 -minute exposures every 48 h)  for 3 months.48          \n \nA low incidence of mortalities (13 of 515 rats and 4 of 15 guinea pigs) was observed in rats and guinea pigs exposed \ncontinuously to 671 ppm Ammonia for 90 days.   However, there were no mortalities or treatment -related histopathological \nfindings in rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, monkeys, or dogs exposed continuously to ~57.43 ppm Ammoni um Hydroxide  for 114 \ndays.48,73 \n \nChronic Toxicity Stu dies \nAnimal  \nDermal  \n \nChronic dermal toxicity data on Ammonium Hydroxide/ Ammonia were not found in the published literature, nor \nwere these data submitted.  \n \nOral  \n \nEnlarged adrenal glands were observed in rabbits that received 124 mg ammonium/kg/day as (as Ammonium \nHydroxide) by gavage in water for 17 months .83 \n \nAmmonium Sulfate (read -across for Ammonia)   \n \nLimited chronic oral toxicity data were available for Ammonia.  However, ammonium sulfate was identified as an \nappropriate read -across surrogate. The chronic ora l toxicity of ammonium sulfate was evaluated using groups of 10 Fischer \n344/DuCrj rats (males and females).  Ammonium sulfate was administered in the diet daily at concentrations of 0%, 0.1%, \n0.6%, and 3% for 52 weeks.  None of the animals died, and there were no macroscopic findings.  There was a significant \nincrease in kidney and/or liver weights in males and females of the 3% dietary group, but there were no effects on survival \nrate, body weights, or hematological, serum biochemical, or histopathological  parameters at any concentration.  Several non -\nneoplastic lesions, such as bile duct proliferation in the liver and focal myocarditis in the heart were observed in the 3% \ndietary group, but also in animals of the control group, and the difference in result s was not statistically significant when the \n2 groups were compared.  The NOAEL for ammonium sulfate was estimated to be 0.6% in both sexes, which is equivalent to 256 and 284 mg/kg/day in males and females, respectively .\n6,84  Neoplastic lesions (classified as unrelated to ammonium \nsulfate in the diet) reported in a carcinogenicity study in the same report are included in  Table 9. \n \n \nDEVELOPMENTAL AND REPRODUCTIVE TOXICITY STUDIES  \n \nDevelopmental/reproductive toxicity studies are summarized below and presented in Table 8.   \n \nA relationship between the duration of exposure and the incidence of exencephaly (concentration -related increase) \nwas observed in an in vitro study in which mouse embryos were cultured with Ammonia (38 to 300 µmol/l) for up to 93 h.89  \nIn a developmental toxicity study involving pregnant rats exposed to Ammonia  in the diet (4293 mg/kg/day ; as the \nammonium ion [read-across for Ammonia ]) from gestation day 1 through day 21 of lactation, body weights of offspring were \nreduced by 25% (males) and 16% (females).9,90  Neither reproductive nor developmental toxicity was reported in a study in \nwhich female pigs were exposed (inhalation exposure) to ~7 ppm or ~35 ppm Ammonia from 6 w eeks prior to breeding until \nday 30 of gestation.91  In an oral reproductive and developmental toxicity study on diammonium phosphate (identified as an \nappropriate read across material f or developmental and reproductive toxicity and included herein to support the overall \nweight of evidence)  involving rats  in which embryos were treated in vitro  and then implanted, an NOAEL of 1500 mg/kg/day \n(highest dose tested) was reported.6,44   The only histological findings relating to maternal toxicity in this study were the \ninflammatory/degen erative changes in all treatment groups (diammonium phosphate at 250, 750, and 1500 mg/kg/day), which were considered likely to have been the result of an irritant effect . No statistically significant differences in the number \nof live fe tuses, fetal length, or fetus -to-corpus luteum ratio were observed after gilts were exposed (inhalation) to Ammonia \n(7 or 35 ppm) from 6 weeks prior to breeding until day 30 of gestation.91 \nGENOTOXICITY STUDIES  \nIn Vitro  \n Ammonia was non -genotoxic when tested at concentrations up to 25,000 ppm (with and without metabolic \nactivation ) in the following bacterial strains:  Salmonella typhimurium  strains TA 98, TA 100, TA 1535, TA 1537, TA1538, \nand Escherichia coli  strain WP2 uvr A .6,48,44 \n \n Ammonia was non -genotoxic to E. coli  strain Sd -4-73 in an in vitro assay without metabolic activation.44 \n \nIn V ivo \nBlood samples from 22 workers who had been exposed to Ammonia (concentration s unknown) in a fertilizer factory \nwere compared with samples obtained from 42 unexposed controls.  Results (compar ed to controls) were as follows:  \nincreased frequency of chromosomal aberrations  (CAs) , sister chromatid exchanges  (SCEs) , and mitotic index, with \nincreasing duration of exposure.   Smokers had higher SCE and CA values than non- smokers and alcoholics had more CAs \nand SCEs than non -alcoholics. 92  \n Ammonia and Ammonium Chloride (read -across for Ammonia)  \n \n An increased frequency of micronuclei (compared to controls) was observed in Swiss albino mice that received \nsingle intraperitoneal (i.p.) doses of Ammonia  (12, 25, or 50 mg/kg).\n  The maximum number of  micronucleated \npolychromatic erythrocytes was associat ed with mice that received the highest dose (50 mg/kg), and there was clear \ncorrelation of dose -yield effects.  In another micronucleus test, groups of 10 (5 males, 5 females) ddY mice received single   \ni.p. doses of 62.5, 125, 250 and 500 mg/kg ammonium c hloride (identified as an appropriate read across material  for in vivo \ngenotoxicity and included to support the overall weight of evidence) or i.p. doses of 31.3, 62.5, 125, and 250 mg/kg \nammonium chloride (4 injections within 24 h).  Femoral bone marrow c ells were examined for polychromatic erythrocytes, \nand there was no evidence of genotoxicity at the doses of ammonium chloride that were administered.6,92 \n \nCARCINOGENICITY  STUDIES  \n Carcinogenicity and tumor promotion studies are summarized below and presented in Table 9. \n \n There was no evidence of a tumorigenic effect in Kid: CFLP mice  treated by gavage with ammonia dissolved in \nwater alone at a dose of 42 mg Ammonia /kg/day for 4 weeks or with diethyl pyrocarbonate alone, but 9 of 16 mice treated \nwith a combination of ammonium ion and diethyl pyrocarbonate developed lung tumors .93  Following the oral dosing of mice \n(Swiss and C3H) with Ammonia  (in drinking water, 193 mg/kg/day ) for 2 years, there was no evidence of carcinogenicit y \nand no effect on the spontaneous development of adenocarcinoma  of the breast (associated with C3H mouse strain).44,48 ,94  \nAmmonium sulfate was classified as non -carcinogenic in rats in a study involving dietary concentrations up to 3% daily for \n104 weeks.84  Neoplastic lesions were observed in this study,  but were deemed not treatment -related because of the \nspontaneous occurrence of these lesions in the rat strain  (F344/DuCrj) that was tested.   Malignant pheochromocytoma of the \nadrenal gland and pituitary adenomas were observed in F344/DuCrj rats fed 3% am monium sulfate, but not 0.1% or 0.6%,  in \nthe diet for 52 weeks.6  After pre gnant HSL mice were exposed (by gavage) to ammonium ion + diethyl pyrocarbonate \nduring pregnancy and lactation , there was no evidence of lung tumors  in mice treated during pregnancy or in the suckling \nmice of dams treated during lactation .95  When 10 mice were exposed (vapor inhalation) to 12% Ammonia solution \nrepeatedly for 8 weeks, carcinoma of the nasal mucosa was observed in 2 mi ce.71 \n  \n When 10 mice were  exposed ( vapor inhalation) to 12% Ammonia solution repeatedly for 8 weeks, carcinoma of the \nnasal mucosa was observed in 2 mice.71 \nTumor  Promotion  \nA statistically significant increase in the incidence of gastric cancer (70%) was observed in rats dosed orally with the \ninitiator  N-methyl- N’-nitro -N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG)  and 0.01% Ammonia, when compared to dosing with MNNG \nalone.96  In another study, the size, depth, and metastasis of MNNG -initiated tumors was enhanced in rats dosed orally with \nAmmonia (~42 mg/kg/day).97      \n OTHER RELEVANT STUDIES  \nNeurotoxicity  \nAmmonia is most toxic in the brain, and chronic hyperammonemia (metabolic disturbance) may lead to brain \ndamage, especially in children.23  During normal body function,  approximately 10% of arterial A mmonia is extracted by the \nbrain.  Neurotoxicity is observed only when circulating levels of A mmonia are elevated.   It has been reported that \nhyperammonemia is associated with neuronal cell loss and cerebral atrophy that lead to mental retardation and cerebral palsy \nin pediat ric patients.98 These toxic effects are specific to the devel oping brain, as neuronal damage  is not observed in the \nbrain of adult patients with hyperammonemia due to liver failure.   \n \nAccording to another source, many neurologic disorders are related to congenital or acquired hyperammonemia.  \nEvidence obtained with the use of experimental hyperammonemia  models suggests that acute neurotoxic effect s of A mmonia \nare mediated by over  activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors, mainly the N-methyl -D-aspartate (NMDA)  receptors, and , \nto a lesser degree,  the kainic acid ( KA)/α-amino -3-hydroxy -5-methyl -4-isoxaz ole propionic acid ( AMPA ) receptors. 99  \nResults from other studies suggest that g lutamine is also a mediator of A mmonia neurotoxicity.100,101 \n \nToxic levels of Ammonia and alterations in pH, electrolyte disturbances, and mem brane potential depolarization are \nthought to lead to neurological dysfunction , primarily by causing cellular swelling accompanied by brain edema and \nmetabolic dysfunction.26,102 Studies have suggested that A mmonia is likely to be particularly toxic to astrocytes, as they are \nthe only cells that possess the enzyme glutamine synthetase (which is responsible for detoxifying Ammonia in the brain \nthrough condensation with glutamate ).103,104 \n In in vitro studies, it has been demonstrated that acute in toxication with large doses of A mmonia leads to excessive \nactivation of  NMDA receptors .\n105,106,107,108  Furthermore, excessi ve activation of NMDA receptors leads to neuronal \ndegeneration and death,  and is responsible for most of the neuronal damage that is found in brain ischemia.105 \nBrain  Pathology  \nThe excessive formation of A mmonia within the brains of Alzheimer’s disease patients and its release into the \nperiphe ry has been demonstrated.109,110  Furthermore, a higher expression of AMP -deaminase in the brains of Alzheimer’s \ndisease patien ts has been observed, and this finding indicates the existence of a pat hologically elevated source of A mmonia \nwithin the brain of Alzheimer’s disease patients.109,111 \nCytotoxicity  \n Lymphocytes separated from peripheral bovine  (Holstein -Friesian cows) blood were incubated for 2 h in control \nmedium and test medium with various concentrations of Ammonia ( w/v as Ammonium Hydroxide; 0.01 mg/dl, 0.1 mg/dl, 1 \nmg/dl, and 10 mg/dl).112  Viability of the lymphocytes , measured by trypan blue exclusion test , was significantl y reduced \nafter 2 h of incubation.   At a concentration of 0.01 mg/ml, lymphocyte viability was significantl y reduced after 24 h and 48 h \nof incubation.  In another experiment, in which lymphocytes were preincubated with A mmonia ( w/v as Ammonium \nHydroxide; 10 mg/dl) and then washed and resusp ended in the fresh medium with Ammonia, the number of viable cells was \nreduced to 51% ± 8 at 24 h, 40% ± 7 at 48 h , and to 39% ± 6 at 72 h of incubation.  \nEffect  on Mitosis  \nThe ability of Ammonia to affect the mitogenic r esponse of bovine lymphocytes to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) or \nconcanavalin A (Con A) was examined.112  Lymphocytes from 10 Holstein- Friesian cows were incubated with various \nconcentrations of PHA and Ammonia.  Lymphocytes from 6 cows were incubated with Con A and Ammonia.  Mitogenic reactivity was measured by the incorporation of methyl - \n3H-thymidine into t he DNA of lymphocytes.  Ammonia at \nconcentrations of 0.01 mg/dl (w/v as Ammonium Hydroxide) significantly (P < 0.01) suppressed PHA (optimal dose = 0.5 \nug/ml) stimulation of lymphocytes from only 1 animal.  Other concentrations of Ammonia, at 0.1 m g/dl, 1 mg/dl, and 10 \nmg/dl (w/v  as Ammonium Hydroxide), significantly (P < 0.01) reduced the response to PHA of lymphocytes from 5 cows, 9 \ncows, and from all animals, respectively.  These concentrations significantly reduced Con A (optimal dose = 0.5 µg/ml) stimu lation of lymphocytes from 1 animal, 5 animals, and all animals, respectively.  A significant suppression (P < 0.01) of \nblastogenesis of lymphocytes from 1 cow by 0.01 mg/dl, 6 by 0.1 mg/dl, 14 by 1.0 mg/dl, and from 16 cows by 10.0 mg/dl \nwas observed.  Th e mitogenic response of lymphocytes was reduced when lymphocytes were preincubated with Ammonia \nfor a duration as short as 1 h.  \nGeneration  of Free Radicals  \nElevated concentrations of A mmonia have been shown to generate free radicals in rats and rat cell cu ltures  (liver \nand brain) ,\n113,114 leading  to excessive production of nitr ic oxide (NO) b y stimulating the citrulline -NO cycle.115 Immunological  Effects  \nA delayed -type hypersensitivity test was used to evaluate cell -mediated immunity in groups of 8 Hartley guinea \npigs.116  The animals were vaccinated with Mycobacterium bovis  bacillus Calmette -Guérin  (BCG) and exposed to Ammonia \n(< 15 ppm, 50 ppm, or 90 ppm  (6.75 µg of Ammonia per deciliter of air )) for 3 weeks.  Exposure to Ammonia was followed \nby intradermal challenge with a purified protein derivative  of tuberculin .  Dermal lesion size was reduced in animals that \nwere exposed to Ammonia at a concentration of 90 ppm (mean diameter of dermal lesion = 8.7 mm, statistically significantly \ndifferent from control (p < 0.05)).  Results were not statistically significant in the 2 other exposure groups.  Also, blood and \nbronchial lymphocytes were harvested from guinea pigs exposed to Ammonia, and the cells were then stimulated with the \nmitogens PHA or Con A.  Reduced T -cell proliferation was observed; however, bactericidal activity in alveolar macrophages \nisolated was not affected.  In an in vitro  experiment in which lymphocytes and macrophages were isolated from unexposed \nHartley guinea pigs and then treated with Ammonia, reduced proliferation and bactericidal capacity were observed only at \nconcentrations tha t reduced viability.  Specifically, the response of blood lymphocytes to Ammonia at 1.0 mg/dl and 10 \nmg/dl, but not ≤ 0.1 mg/dl, significantly reduced (p < 0.01) the response to phytohemagglutinin stimulation.  The exposure of \nalveolar macrophages to Ammonia at 1 mg/dl and 5 mg/dl, but not 0.01 mg/dl or 0.1 mg/dl, caused significant inhibition  (p < \n0.01)  of bactericidal activity.  These results were indicative of nonspecific effects of Ammonia- induced immunosuppression.  \nThe authors noted that the data in this study indicate that T cells may be the target of Ammonia exposure, in that specific \nmacrophage effects were not observed.  \nNeurological  Effects  \nAcute inhalation exposure to low levels of A mmonia (100 or 300 ppm) for 6 h continuously has been shown to  \ndepress free- access wheel running behavior in rodents.117  \nDERMAL IRRITATION AND SENSITZATION STUDI ES \nIrritation  \n \nDermal irritation studies are summarized in  Table 10. \n \n An undiluted Ammonia solution (as 30% Ammonium Hydroxide) was classified as a corrosive material after topical \napplication to the stratum corneum surface in reconstructed human skin cultures in vitro.118  At histologic examination of the \ncultures, epidermal necrosis was observed.  The minimum concentration of Ammonia that caused an inflammatory reaction \nwhen applied (single application) to the skin of rats and mice (6 per species) was > 25% (rats) and = 25% (mice).119  In a skin \nirritation study in which groups of 4 ra ts, guinea pigs, and mice were injected intradermally with Ammonia (0.01 ml), the \nminimum concentration that caused a positive reaction was 0.05% in rats, mice, and guinea pigs.119 Ammonia (20% as \nAmmonium Hydroxide) was corrosive to the skin of rabbits.20,44  In another study involving rabbits, 12% aqueous Ammonia \nwas corrosive to the skin, whereas 10% was not.6   \n \nIn clinical testing, the application of a saturated aqueous solution of Ammonia to the skin of 16 subjects resulted in \nblister formation and skin irritation.120  In a study involving 110 subjects, Ammonia (1:1 aqueous solution) was applied to the \nskin and minimal blistering time (MBT) served as an indicator of cutaneous irritability.121  The inflammatory reaction \nobserved was considered slight, and MBT ranged from 3 to 57 minutes.  Results from an other study in which 50% \nAmmonium Hydroxide  solution (0.5 ml of freshly prepared 1:1 aqueous  solution of Ammonium Hydroxide) was applied to \nthe skin indicated that the time required to produce a full blister was greatly prolonged in the aged, when compared to young adults .\n122          \n \nSensitization  \n Skin sensitization data on Ammonia were not found in the published literature, nor were these data submitted.  \n \nOCULAR IRRITATION STUDIES  \n Ocular irritation studies are summarized in  Table 11. \n  Ammonia was classified as a severe ocular irritant in th e in vitro \n51Cr-release assay involving human corneal \nendothelial cell cultures .123  In rabbits, Ammonia (as  Ammonium  Hydroxide) at 1 mg was classif ied as an ocular irritant.44  \nAt a concentration of 28.5%, Ammonia induced corneal opacity in rabbits.9,124  In a study involving groups of 6 rabbits, \nAmmo nium Hydroxide  caused  conjunctivitis at concentrations of 1% to 10%, but not 0.3%; the 10% concentration also \ncaused corneal opacities within 1 h of instillation.125  Conjunctivitis and corneal damage were also observed in a study \ninvolving 3 rabbits, whereby 3% Ammonia, 100 µ l was instilled into the eyes .126     9,44,123,124,125,126  \nIn a study involving rats, there was no evidence of ocular irritation following exposure to Ammonia  at vapor  \n concentrations ranging from 15 to 1157 ppm.24,40   \n \nMUCOUS MEMBRANE IRRI TATION STUDIES  \n The stomachs of male Sprague- Dawley rats were exposed ( mounted in an ex vivo gastric chamber ) to 2 ml of \nAmmonia (15-60 mmol/l, in saline ) for 15 minutes  (for microscopic study)  or for 60 minutes (for macroscopic study) , and \nexposure was followed by examination for mucosal lesions.  Microscopic damage to the gastric mucosa was obs erved.127 \n    \n \nCLINICAL STUDIES  \nCase  Reports  \nA 68 -yr-old male patient, employed for 18 years , was e xposed frequently to anhydrous A mmonia leaks from a \nmicrofilm processor camera while on the job .  He was diagnosed with interstitial lung disease and severe r estrictive lung \ndisease due to Ammonia inhalation.   Marked diffuse interstitial fibrosis throughout the lung was observ ed.128 \n \nA male custodian had used Ammonia (28% Ammonium Hydroxide solution; which he dilutes in water ) to clean \noffice floors daily for 19 years.129  He experienced regular episodes of upper airway irritation, coughing, a nd eye irritation \nwhen mixing the chemical in water.  An evaluation of the patient revealed a negative rheumatoid factor and positive antinuclear antibody at a 1:320 dilution.  The gallium lung scan was normal, but pulmonary function testing indicated a \nmoderate restrictive defect and a formal exercise study indicated ventilator restriction upon attainment of maximum oxygen \nconsumption.  The results of a transbronchial lung biopsy with fiberoptic bronchoscopy revealed interstitial fibrosis with \nchronic infl ammation.  Granulomata were not present and cultures for tuberculosis and fungal infection were negative.  A \ndecrease in the diameter of the hypopharynx, secondary to hypertrophy of the soft tissues in the hypopharynx, was also \nobserved.   The opacificatio n of the optic lens capsule, bronchiectasis, and fibrous obliteration of the small airways observed \nwere described as chronic lesions that follow acute exposure to Ammonia.  \nOther Clinical Reports  \n Clinic al reports relating to inhalation exposure are summar ized in  Table 12. \n  In various clinical reports, individuals were exposed to Ammonia at concentrations ranging from 25 ppm to 700 \nppm.   The periods of exposure ranged from 5 minutes to 6 weeks (5 days per week [2 -6 h/day]).  Nose, throat, and eye \nirritation were observed.\n9,47,53,79,130,131 ,132,133 \n \nEPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES  \nNon-Cancer Endpoints  \n \n A retrospective study was performed  to assess the association between petrochemical exposure and spontaneous \nabortion.  Study participants included 2853 non- smoking women who had been pregnant at least once, 96 of whom had been \nexposed to Ammonia (actual exposure levels unknown).  Exposure during the pre -conception period and the first trimester of \npregnancy was calculated based on information on perceived Ammonia exposure.  Exposure during the first, second, and third trimesters was recorded separately for each pregnancy.   Data analyses did not indicate any effect on spontaneous \nabortion (Odds ratio: 1.2; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.5- 2.60.\n6  \n \nOCCUPATIONAL EXPOSUR E \nAirway Inflammation  \n \n Airway inflammatio n due to Ammonia exposure was evaluated in female Palestinian hairdressers in Hebron who \nhad worked in this profession for 12 ± 7 years .134  Study participants included 33 non -smoking hairdressers (from 13 salons \ntotal) and 35 non -smoking control subjects.  The hairdressers worked in re latively small -sized salons with scarce ventilation, \nlacked respiratory protective equipment, and were exposed to Ammonia concentrations ranging from 3 to 61 mg/m3 \n(geometric mean = 7.3 mg/m3; geometric standard deviation = 3)  .  The longest and shortest d urations of Ammonia  \nmeasurement in a salon were 45 m inutes and 305 minutes, respectively.  Peak exposure to Ammonia was evaluated by \nobtaining the number and duration of peaks above 10.5 mg/m3 for each measurement session in a salon.  The percentage of \ntotal sampling time when Ammonia levels exceeded 10.5 mg/m3 was very high in 3 salons (percentages of 92%, 99.6%, and 75%, respectively).  Both  groups completed a questionnaire relating to respiratory symptoms during the past 12 months, and \nlung function and exhaled nitric oxide tests were performed.  Blood and sputum samples were collected from all participants.  \nWhen compared to unexposed contr ols, hairdressers were found to have a higher level of sputum neutrophil count ( i.e., sign  \nof neutrophilic airway inflammation; absolute numbers of neutrophils per mg sputum:  376 (for hairdressers) versus 182 (for \ncontrols)).  The hairdressers also had s ignificantly elevated exhaled nitric oxide levels and blood C reactive protein levels  \nwhen compared to control subjects (controlled for age and body mass index).  \n \nInhalation  - Risk Assessment  \n \nA minimal risk level (MRL) of 1.7 ppm has been derived for “acute -duration” inhalation exposure (14 days or less) \nto Ammonia.  The study involved 16 subjects exposed to Ammonia (50 ppm, 80 ppm, 110 ppm, or 140 ppm).  The MRL is \nbased on a LOAEL of 50 ppm for mild irritation to the eyes (6 subjects), nose (20 subjects) , and throat (9 subjects) in humans \nexposed to Ammonia as a gas for 2 hours.  The 1.7 ppm MRL was calculated ( 50 ppm ÷ 30 [uncertainty factor] = 1.7; \nuncertainty factor =  10 [to protect sensitive individuals] x 3 [for use of a minimal LOAEL] = 30 ).79  It should be noted that \nthe Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has established an 8- hour time weighted average exposure limit \nof 50 ppm (35 mg/m3) for A mmonia in the workplace.80  Exposure to Ammonia shall not exceed the 50 ppm limit in any 8 -h \nwork shift of a 40 -h work week.  \n \nChronic occupational exposure (about 12.2 years) to low levels of airborne A mmonia ( 9.2 ppm) had no significant  \neffect on pulmonary function or odor sensitivity in a group of workers at a soda ash factory , compared to a control group \nfrom the same factory that was not exposed to Ammonia.85  The ATSDR derived  a chronic inhalation MRL  of 0.1 ppm for \nAmmonia from this study .9  An MRL is an estimate of the  daily human exposure to a hazardous substance that is likely to be \nwithout appreciable risk of adverse non -cancer health effects over a specified duration of exposure. MRLs are based on non -\ncancer health effects only and are not based on a consideration o f cancer effects.   Derivation of the MRL is described below.   \n \nAn MRL of 0.1 ppm has been derived for chronic -duration inhalation exposure (365 days or  more) to A mmonia. \nThe MRL is based on a NOAEL of 9.2 ppm for sense of smell, prevalence of respiratory s ymptoms (cough, bronchitis, \nwheeze, dyspnea, and others), eye and throat irritation, and lung function parameters ( forced vital capacity ( FVC ), forced \nexpiratory volume  at end of  1 second of forced expiration ( FEV1 ), FEV1/FVC, forced expiratory flow at 50% of FVC \n(FEF50 ), and FEF at 75% of FVC ( FEF75 )) in humans exposed for an average of 12.2 years in a soda ash plant; no LOAEL \nwas determined.85 The cohort consisted of 52 workers and 35 controls  (all males) .  The subjects were assessed on the first and \nlast workday of th eir workweek. Spirometry was performed at the beginning and end of each work shift, so that each worker \nhad four tests done. To determine the exposure levels, exposed and control workers were sampled (breathing zone air sample) \nover one work shift; the ave rage sample collection period was 8.4 hours.  Air samples were collected on sulfuric acid -treated \nsilica gel adsorption tubes (tube holder attached to the collar).  \n \nAnalysis of the results showed no significant differences in the prevalence of reported sym ptoms, but the exposed \nworkers reported that exposure in the plant aggravated some of their reported symptoms (cough, wheeze, nasal complaints, \neye irritation, and throat discomfort).  There were no significant differences in baseline lung functions betwee n exposed and \ncontrol subjects. Analysis of each worker separately showed no significant rel ationship between the level of A mmonia \nexposure and changes in lung function.  Also, when the workers were divided into groups of individuals that were exposed to \nlow (<  6.25 ppm), medium (6.25  – 12.5 ppm), and high (> 12.5 ppm) A mmonia levels, no significant association was found \nbetween reporting of symptoms, decline in baseline function, or increasing decline in function over the work shift and \nexposure to A mmonia .  Furthermore, no association was evident between increasing years of exposure and decreasing lung \nfunction. However, the power of the indices of both level and length of exposure is low because only eight workers were  in \nareas with relatively high A mmoni a exposure. The MRL was calculated by adjusting the mean time- weighted average \n(TWA ) exposure concentration of 9.2 ppm for continuous exposure (8/24 hours x 5/7 days) and dividing by an uncertainty \nfactor of 10 to protect all of the sensitive individuals. A modifying factor of 3 was added for the lack of reproductive and \ndevelopmental studies.9  \n Based on occupational epidemiology studies, the EPA calculated a chronic inhalation reference concentration (RfC)  \nof 0.5 mg/m\n3.2  The critical effects in these studies were decreased lung function and respiratory symptoms.86,85,87, 88   The RfC \nis an estimate (with uncertainty ~ one order of magnitude) of a continuous inhalation exposure to the human population \n(including sensitive subgroups) that is likely to be without an apprec iable risk of deleterious effects during a lifetime.  \n  \nSUMMARY \nThe safety of Ammonia and Ammonium Hydroxide as used in cosmetics is reviewed in this safety assessment.  \nAccording to the Dictionary , both ingredients function as pH adjusters in cosmetic products.  Additionally, Ammonia functions as an external analgesic and fragrance ingredient and Ammonium Hydroxide functions as a denaturant in cosmetic \nproducts.  Functioning as an external analgesi c is not a cosmetic use and, therefore, the Panel did not evaluate safety in \nrelation to that use in cosmetics .  Additionally, the function of fragrance may be excluded from the purview of the Panel . \n \nAccording to 2017 VCRP data, Ammonia is being used in 5 99 cosmetic products (mostly rinse -off products) and \nAmmonium Hydroxide is being used in 1354 cosmetic products (mostly rinse -off products).   These uses of both ingredients \nare mostly in hair  coloring products .  The results of a concentration of use survey  provided by the Council in 2017 indicate \nthat the highest maximum cosmetic use concentration of Ammonia is 4.6% (in rinse off products (hair dyes and colors)) and \nthe highest maximum cosmetic use concentration of Ammonium Hydroxide is 12.5% (in rinse off products (hair dyes and \ncolors)).  Regarding use concentrations in leave -on products, the highest maximum cosmetic use concentrations are 0.73% \n(Ammonia - in tonics, dressings, and other hair grooming aids) and 1.5% (Ammonium Hydroxide - in face and neck p roducts \n(not spray)).  \n \nThese two ingredients are indistinguishable from each other in aqueous formulation.  Since the only cosmetic \nfunction of Ammonia applicable to this  safety assessment is pH adjuste r (which by default means aqueous formulations only) \nand Ammonium Hydroxide does not exist outside of water, regardless of which ingredient is added the final formulations \nwill contain an equilibrium of molecular Ammonia and the ions of Ammonium Hydroxide in water.  Thus, whether toxicity \ndata is reported for Ammonia or Ammonium Hydroxide , it is applicable to both  (as the test articles would have had this same \nequilibrium) . \n \nA large amo unt of metabolically -generated A mmonia is absorbed into the blood and  is detoxified  by the liver.   The \nurea cycle (in liver) , a cycle of biochemical reactions that produces urea from A mmonia, is the major pathway for A mmonia \ndetoxification in terrestrial mammals.   The normal range for Ammonia blood serum levels has been reported as 10 -40 \nµmol/L.  \n \n An acute oral LD 50 of 350 mg/kg ha s been reported in a study involving rats dosed orally with Ammonia dissolved \nin water.  Gastric lesions in rats have been observed after oral dosing (gavage) with 0.03% to 1% Ammonia and 1% and 3% \nAmmonium  Hydroxide.  The increase in gastric lesions obser ved was both concentration - and pH -dependent.  \n  It has been noted that acute exposure data have demonstrated that injury to respiratory tissues is primarily due to \nAmmonia’s alkaline (i.e., caustic) properties from the formation of hydroxide when it reacts  with water.  In acute inhalation \ntoxicity studies, Ammonia was tested at concentrations ranging from 3.5 ppm (cats and rabbits, 1 h exposure) to 54,289 ppm (rats, 10 -minute exposure).  Exposure to the highest concentration resulted in hemorrhagic lungs, a nd increased respiratory \nfluid output was noted at the lowest concentration.  In 10 -minute exposure studies involving mice, LC\n50 values ranging from \n8723 ppm to 10,150 ppm have been reported.   In mice  exposed to Ammonia (100 - 800 ppm) for 30 minutes, an RD 50 of 303 \nppm was reported.   Within the range of concentrations  tested  (3440 ppm to 12,940 ppm) in 1- h exposure studies involving \nmice , the following effects have been observed:  hepatic lesions, congestion, and necrosis; eye irritation; dyspnea; \npneumonitis and atelectasis; histopathological changes in the lung (alveolar disruption and loss of septal continuity), and, in some cases, coma and death.  \n \n Exposure durations ranged from 10 minutes (14,170 -55,289 ppm) to 1- 4 h (3028- 5053 ppm) in acute inhalation \ntoxicity studies involving rats.  For the 10- minute exposure, LC\n50 values were ~ 22,885 ppm (males) and ~31,430 ppm \n(females) (at highest exposure concentration) and ~14,141 ppm (males) and ~19,769 ppm (females) (at lowest exposure \nconcentration).  For the 1 h and 4 h exposures, the LC 50s were ~17,633 ppm and ~7068 ppm, respectively, and corneal \nopacity and signs of typical upper respiratory t ract irritation were observed.  \n  In short -term oral toxicity studies involving rats, doses of ~ 42 mg/kg/day for  8 weeks resulted in mucosal atrophy \nin the stomach antrum, and doses  up to 1500 mg/kg/day for 35 days resulted in treatment -related changes in body weight, \nhematological findings, clinical biochemistry findings, and non -neoplastic histopathological findin gs.  \n  \nAmmonia was evaluated at concentrat ions ranging from 0.6 ppm to 1306 ppm in short- term inhalation toxicity  \nstudies.  The results of these studies indicate histopathological changes of respiratory tissues in several animal species (lung \ninflammation in guinea pigs and rats; focal or interstitial pneumonitis in monkeys, dogs, rabbits, and guinea pigs; pulmonary \ncongestion in mice; thickening of nasal epithelium in rats and pigs; nasal inflammation or lesions in rats and mice) across different dosing re gimens.  In general, responses in respiratory tis sues increased with increasing A mmonia exposure \nconcentration.  \n \nFatty changes of liver plate  cells were seen in rats following continuous exposure  to Ammonia (642 ppm) for 90 \ndays.  Mild congestion/degenerative changes in internal organs were reported for guinea pigs exposed to ~ 170 ppm Ammonia for 18 weeks.  Damaged tracheal mucosae were observed in rats exposed repeated ly to Ammonia ( 100 ppm ) for 12 \nweeks.  Mild leukocytosis was noted in rats after exposure to 143 ppm, but not 43 ppm  of Ammonia repeatedly for 3 months  (25- or 60 -minute exposures every 48 h) .   A low incidence of mortalities (13 of 515 rats and 4 of 15 guinea pigs) was \nobserved in mice and guinea pigs exposed continuously to 671 ppm Ammonia (reported as Ammonium Hydroxide) for 90 \ndays.  However, there were no mortalities or treatment -related histopathological findings in rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, \nmonkeys, or dogs exposed continuously to ~57.43 ppm for 114 days.  \n \nEnlarged adrenal glands were observed in  rabbits that rece ived 124 mg  /kg/day Ammonia (as Ammonium \nHydroxide ) by gavage in water for  17 months . \n \nIn a developmental toxicity study involving pregnant rats exposed to Ammonia in the diet (4293 mg/kg/day; as the \nammonium ion [read-across  for Ammonia ]) from gestation day 1 through day 21 of lactation, body weights of male and \nfemale offspring were reduced.  Neither reproductive nor developmental toxicity were reported in a study in which female \npigs were exposed (inhalation exposure) to ~7 ppm or ~35 ppm Ammonia from 6 weeks prior to breeding until day 30 of \ngestation.   In an oral reproductive and developmental toxicity study on diammonium phosphate (identified as an appropriate \nread across material for developmental and reproductive toxicity and included herein to support the overall weight of evidence)  involving rats in which embryos were treated in vitro  and then implanted, a  NOAEL of 1500 mg/kg/day (highest \ndose tested) was re ported.     \n \nIn the Ames test with and without metabolic activation, Ammonia was non -genotoxic in S. typhimurium  strains and \nin E. coli strain WP2 uvr A.  Without metabolic activation, it was non -genotoxic to E. coli  strain Sd -4-73.  An increased \nfrequency of micronuclei (compared to controls) was observed in Swiss albino mice that received single i.p. doses of \nAmmonia  (12, 25, or 50 mg/kg).\n  The maximum number of  micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes was associated with \nmice that received the highest dose (50 mg/kg), and there was clear correlation of dose -yield effects.  In another micronucleus \ntest, groups of 10 (5 males, 5 females) ddY mice received single i.p. doses of 62.5, 125, 250 and 500 mg/kg ammonium chloride (read-across  for Ammonia , or i.p. doses of 31.3, 62.5, 125, and 250 mg/kg ammonium chloride (4 injections within \n24 h).  Ammonium chloride was not genotoxic.\n6 \n Increased frequencies of chromosomal aberrations, sister chromatid exchanges, and mitotic index, with increasing \nduration of exposure were reported for workers who had been exposed to Ammonia in a fertilizer factory.   \n Ammonia (whether reported as Ammonia or Ammonium Hydroxide) was not carcinogenic in Swiss and C3H mice \ndosed orally. A statistically significant increase in the incidence of gastric cancer (70%) was observed in rats dosed orally \nwith MNNG and 0.01% Ammonia, when compared to dosing with MNNG alone.  In another study, the size, depth, and \nmetastasis of MNNG -initiated tumors were enhanced in rats dosed orally with Ammonia (~42 mg/kg/day).   There was no \nevidence of a tumorigenic effect in Kid: CFLP mice\n treated by gavage with ammonia dissolved in water alone at a dose of \n42mg/kg/day of Ammonia for 4 weeks or with diethyl pyrocarbonate alone, but 9 of 16 mice treated with a combination of \nammonium and pyrocarbonate developed lung tumors.   In inbred HSL mice treated by gavage with ammonium ion + diethyl \npyrocarbonate during pregnancy and lactation, lung tumors were not observed in mice treated during pregnancy or in the \nsuckling mice of dams treated during lactation.  Ammonium sulfate was classified as non -carcinogenic in rats in a study \ninvolving di etary concentrations up to 3% daily for 104 weeks.  Neoplastic lesions were observed in this study, but were \ndeemed not treatment -related because of the spontaneous occurrence of these lesions in the rat strain  (F344/DuCrj) that was \ntested.  \n \nIt has been re ported that hyperammonemia  (a metabolic disturbance characteriz ed by an excess of Ammonia in the \nblood ) is associated with neuronal cell loss and cerebral atrophy that lead to mental retardation and cerebral palsy in pediatric \npatients . \n \nAt a concentration of 0.01 mg/ml  Ammonia, bovine lymphocyte viability was significantly reduced after 24 h and \n48 h of incubation.  In another study, the mitogenic response of lymphocytes was reduced after preincubation with Ammonia.  \n \n Guinea pigs exposed to 90 ppm A mmonia for 3 weeks developed a significant decrease in the  cell-mediated \nimmune response to challenge with a derivative of tuberculin.  \n \nNo overt symptoms of  neurological disorders were reported in guinea pigs or monkeys that were exposed to up to \n1105 ppm  Ammonia  for 6 weeks . \n The minimum concentration of Ammonia that caused an inflammatory reaction when applied (single application) to \nthe skin of rats and mice (6 per species) was > 25% (rats) and = 25% (mice).  In a skin irritation study in which groups of 4 \nrats, guinea pigs, and mice were injected intradermally with Ammonia (0.01 ml), the minimum concentration that caused a \npositive reaction was 0.05% in rats, mice, and guinea pigs.   Ammonia (reported as Ammonium Hydroxide; 20% and 12%) \nwas corrosive to the skin of rabbits, whereas the 10% concentration was not.  \n  The application of a saturated aqueous solution of Ammonia (reported as Ammonium Hydroxide) to the skin of 16 \nsubjects resulted in blister formation and skin irritation.  In a study involving 110 subjects, Ammonia (reported as \nAmmonium Hydroxide; 1:1 aque ous solution) was applied to the skin and the inflammatory reaction observed was \nconsidered slight.  \n In rabbits, Ammonia (1 mg of Ammonium Hydroxide) was classified as an ocular irritant and 28.5% Ammonia \n(reported as Ammonium Hydroxide) induced corneal opacity.  Additionally, Ammonia caused conjunctivitis in rabbits at \nconcentrations of 1% to 10% (reported as Ammonium Hydroxide), but not 0.3%.  \n Microscopic damage to the gastric mucosa was observed in the stomachs of male rats exposed (ex vivo) to \nAmmonia ( up to 60 mmol/l of Ammonium Hydroxide) for 15 minutes.  \n \n In various clinical reports, ocular, nasal, and throat irritation were observed in human subjects exposed to Ammonia \nin the 25 ppm to 700 ppm concentration range.  \n \nA retrospective study was performed  to assess the association between petrochemical exposure and spontaneous \nabortion.  Study participants included 2853 non- smoking women who had been pregnant at least once, 96 of whom had been \nexposed to unknown Ammonia concentrations.  Data analyses did not indicate any effect on spontaneous abortion.  \n \nResults from an occupational exposure study indicated that female Palestinian hairdressers exposed to high levels of \nAmmonia in the workplace had higher neutrophilic airway inflammation when compared to a non-exposed control group.  \nDISCUSSION  \nThe Panel noted that Ammonia and Ammonium Hydroxide, well -known skin irritants, are indistinguishable from \neach other in aqueous formulation.  Furthermore,  since the only cosmetic function of Ammonia applicable to this  safety \nassessment is pH adjuster (which by default  means aqueous formulations only) and  Ammonium Hydroxide does not exist \noutside of water, regardless of which ingredient is added, the final  formulations will contain an equilibrium of molecular  \nAmmonia an d the ions of Ammonium Hydroxide in water. Thus, whether toxicity data are reported for Ammonia or  \nAmmonium Hydroxide, these data are applicable to  both (as the test articles would have had this same equilibrium).  \n \nThe Panel addressed the use of chemicals for read -across, and determined that information reported for the \nfollowing chemicals is appropriate for read -across to Ammonia and Ammonium Hydroxide : data on “ammonium ion”  \n(reproductive and developmental toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenicity data ; counter -ion not identified ) that are included \nin the ATSDR  toxicological profile for Ammonia ; diammonium phosphate (repeated dose (short -term) oral toxicity and \nreproductive and developmental toxicity  data)  that are included in the CIR Final Report on Ph osphoric Acid and Its Salts and  \nin an ECHA registration dossier on Ammonia ; and data on ammonium chloride (genotoxicity data [micronucleus test]) and  \nammonium sulfate (oral carcinogenicity and chronic oral toxic ity data) that are included also included in the ECHA dossier.  \nAmmonium Hydroxide, diammonium phosphate, ammonium chloride, and ammonium sulfate are all low- formula -weight, \ninorganic ammonium salts.  The Panel stated that, because the distribution and metabolism of the ammonium exposure from \nthese salts should be essentially identical, information on diammonium phosphate, ammonium chloride, and ammonium \nsulfate is useful for evaluating  the safety of Ammonia and Ammonium Hydroxide.  The use of these chemicals  for read -\nacross is presented in Table 1. \n \nSkin sensitization data are absent from the safety assessment .  However, the Panel noted that these ingredients are \ncorrosive, but there are no concerns relating to the sensitization potential of Ammonia or Ammonium Hydroxide.   Therefore, \nthe Panel determined that cosmetic products containing these ingredients should be formulated to be non- irritating , and that \nskin contact should be avoided to mi nimize irritation . \n \n Lastly, the Panel recognized that there are reports of safety issues relating to chronic ingredient exposure \nexperienced by hairdresser s, but acknowledged that evaluation of occupational safety is not within the purview of the Panel.   \nHowever, the Panel reviewed one such report in which hairdressers had signs of airway inflammation after exposure to Ammonia at concentrations up to 61 mg/m\n3 in relatively small -sized salons with scarce ventilation.  The Panel questioned the \nvalidity of this study in terms of any association between Ammonia inhalation exposure and airway inflammation, having \nnoted that many chemicals are present in the salon environment.  \nCONCLUSION  \n The CIR Expert Panel concluded that Ammonia and Ammonium Hydroxide are  safe as used in hair dyes and colors \nand safe in cosmetics applied directly to the skin in the present practices of use and concentration described in the safety \nassessment when formulated to be n on-irritating.  \n   TABLES  \n \nTable 1.

The Panel reviewed the available data to determine the safety of these  ingredient s, noting that \nthese ingredients may cause dermal irritation.  Further, the  Panel also noted  the potential for polyunsaturated fatty acids to \nundergo oxidation during the formulation of cosmetic products , which  may produce compounds that may be dermal sensitizers .  \nThe Panel concluded that fatty acids and fatty acid salts are safe in cosmetics in the present practices of use and concentration \ndescribed in this safety assessment when formulated to be non -irritating and non -sensitizing, which may be determined based \non a quantitative risk assessment  (QRA) . \n  \nINTRODUCTION  \nThis report addresses the safety of 102 fatty acid and fatty acid salts  (listed below)  as used in cosmetics.  Most of the \nfatty acids and fatty acid salts  detailed in this safety assessment are reported to function as anticaking agents, emulsion \nstabilizer s, viscosity increasing agent s, opacifying agents , and surfactants , according to the web -based International Cosmetic \nIngredient Dictionary and Handbook  (wINCI; Dictionary ; see Table 1).1 Additional reported functions included hair and skin \nconditioning agents, binders, slip modifier, antioxidants, fragrance ingredients, colorants, skin protectants, cosmetic biocide, \nand film formers. F unctions  such as oral health care drug (for Isomerized Safflower Acid) and antifungal agent (for Calcium \nUndecylenate and Undecyleni c Acid) are not considered cosmetic functions in the United States (US) and, therefore, do not fall \nunder the purview of the Cosmetic Ingredient Review ( CIR).  \n \nAluminum Dilinoleate  \nAluminum Distearate  \nAluminum Isostearate  \nAluminum Isostear ates/Palmitates  \nAluminum Isostearates/Stearates  \nAluminum Isostearates/Laurates/Palmitates  \nAluminum Isostearates/Laurates/Stearates  \nAluminum Lanolate  \nAluminum Stearate  \nAluminum Stearates  \nAluminum Tristearate  \nAmmonium Isostearate  \nAmmonium Oleate  \nAmmonium Stearate  \nArachidic Acid  \nBeeswax Acid  \nBehenic Acid  \nC14-28 Alkyl Acid  \nC10-40 Isoalkyl Acid \nC14-28 Isoalkyl Acid  \nC32-36 Isoalkyl Acid  \nCalcium Behenate  \nCalcium Laurate  \nCalcium Stearate  \nCalcium Undecylenate  \nCapric Acid  \nCaproic Acid  \nCaprylic Acid  \nDilinoleic Acid  \nDierucic Acid   \nEicosatrienoic Acid  \nErucic Acid  \nHydroxycapric Acid  \nHydroxycaprylic Acid  \n10-Hydroxydecanoic Acid  \nHydroxylauric Acid  \nHydroxystearic Acid  \n10-Hydroxystearic Acid  \nIsomerized Linoleic Acid  Isomerized Safflower  Acid  Isostearic Acid  \nLauric Acid  \nLinoleic Acid  \nLinolenic Acid  \nLithium Stearate  Magnesium L anolate  \nMagnesium Laurate  \nMagnesium Palmitate  \nMagnesium Stearate  \nMagnesium Tallowate  \nMyristic A cid  \nMethyl Myristic Acid   Oleic Acid  \nPalmitic Acid  \nPotassium Behenate  \nPotassium Borageate \nPotassium Camelliate  \nPotassium Caprate  \nPotassium Caprylate  \nPotassium Caprylate/Caprate  \nPotassium Castorate  \nPotassium Hydrogenated Tallowate  \nPotassium Hydroxystearate  \nPotassium Isostearate  \nPotassium Lanolate  \nPotass ium Laurate  \nPotassium Linoleate  \nPotassium Linseedate  \nPotassium Oleate  \nPotassium Olivate/Sunflowerseedate  \nPotassium Palmitate  \nPotassium Stearate  \nPotassium Sunflowerseedate  \nPotassium Tallate  \nPotassium Tallowate  \nPotassium Undecylenate  \nSodium Arganate  \nSodium Beeswax \nSodium Behenate  \nSodium Camellia Japonica Seedate Sodium Caprate  \nSodium Caprylate  \nSodium Castorate  \nSodium Dilinoleate  \nSodium Hydrogenated Tallowate  \nSodium Hydroxystearate  \nSodium Isostearate  Sodium Lanolate  \nSodium Lardate  \nSodium Laurate  \nSodium Laurate/Linoleate/Oleate/Palmitate  Sodium Linoleate  \nSodium Oleate  \nSodium Palmitate  \nSodium Stearate  \nSodium Tallowate  \nSodium Tamanuseedate \nSodium Undecylenate  \nStearic Acid  Trilinoleic Acid  \nUndecanoic Acid  \nUndecylenic Acid  \n \nWhile most  of the fatty acids ( such as Linoleic Acid, with reported use in 633 cosmetic formulations)\n2 and fatty acid \nsalts have not been previously review ed by the Panel , several  previously assessed  ingredients have been included herein  \n(denoted in  red above)  as they fit within this grouping of fatty acids and salts and can be appropriately re -reviewed herein .3-11  \nEach of the ingredients in this report comprises a carboxylic acid functional group and an aliphatic (fatty) chain.   Pertinent data \nfrom the reports on the previously reviewed fatty acids and fatty acid salts  are summarized in the appropriate sections of this \nreport in italics.   Note: T he Panel has previously reviewe d the safety of Arachidonic Acid; however, this ingredient is not \nincluded in this assessment because the Panel found the data were insufficient to determine safety.12  Dermal absorption data \nwere needed, and if absorbed, additional data are required.  The conclusion was subsequently reclassified as “Use Not \nSupported by the Data and Information Submitted to the CIR,” per the CIR Procedures.   Additionally , several relat ed \ningredients  have also been reviewed  and are referred to herein as supplemental information .13-19  The conclu sions for the \npreviously assessed fatty acids and fatty acid salts  and the other related ingredients have been provided in Table 2.  \nMost of the fatty acid ingredients described in this safety assessment  are ubiquitous in food as dietary fats . The US \nFood and Drug Administration (FDA)  has affirmed that Calcium Stearate, Caprylic Acid, Linoleic Acid, Magnesium Ste arate, \nSodium Oleate, Sodium Palmita te, and Stearic Acid are generally recognized as safe (GRAS) as direct or indirect food \nsubstances.   The US FDA has also affirmed that Oleic Acid is GRAS as a substance migrating from food packaging.  \nAdditionally, the US FDA has determined that several of  the fatty acids and salts of fatty acids are approved as food additives \npermitted for direct addition to food for human consumption  (see the Non -Cosmetic Use section for the complete list).  Daily \nconsumption of these ingredients  would result in much larger systemic exposures than what is expected from use in cosmetic \nproducts, even if there was 100% absorption. A sampling of the  systemic toxicity via  oral exposure has been included in this \nreport; however, t he primary focus of safety for  the ingredients t hat are approved direct food additives is based on topical \nexposure  and local effects . \nThe available data in the published literature on fatty acids is voluminous.  For this report , a representative sampling \nof the most pertinent published data, as identified by conducting an exhaustive search of the world’s literature , has been \nincluded  for each endpoint that is evaluated .  This safety assessment  also includes  unpublished data .  A listing of the search \nengines and websites that are used and the sou rces that are typically explored, as well as the endpoints that CIR typically \nevaluates, is provided on the CIR website ( https://www.cir -safety.org/supple mentaldoc/ preliminary -search -engines -and-\nwebsites ; https://www.cir -safety.org/supplementaldoc/cir -report -format -outline ).  Unpublished data are provided by the \ncosmetics industry, as well as by other interested parties.  \nSome chemical and toxicological data on the fatty acids and fatty acid salts included in this safety assessment were \nobtained from robust summaries of data submitted to the European Chemical Agency (ECHA) b y companies as part of the \nREACH chemical registration process.20-33  Additionally, some data were  obtained from an assessment  by the Organisation for \nEconomic Co -Operation and Development Screening Information Data Sets (OEC D SIDS).34-36  These data summaries are \navailable on the ECHA and OECD SIDS  websites, respectively, and when deemed appropriate, information from the \nsummaries has been included in this report.   \n \nCHEMISTRY  \nDefinition s and Structure s \nThe definitions and structures of the fatty acids and fatty acid salts  included in this safety assessment are detailed in \nTable 1. Fatty acids , or alip hatic acids, consist of a carboxyl ic acid  group at the polar end and a non- polar hydrocarbon chain.36 \nThe general structure for these acids in mono form is :  \n \nFigure 1.  Generic fatty acid/salt structure ( where in R is a hydrogen  atom  or an ammonium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, or \ncalcium cation .  The chain lengths for fatty acids are 4 to 40 carbons in length (i.e., n is 2 to 38)) .  \n \n \n \nFigure 2. Specific example of a fatty acid salt  with a 10 carbon chain length, Sodium Caprate   \n \nWhile some of these ingredients consist  of straight (i.e. , not branched) alkanes (saturated chains; i.e. , no double bonds) like \nSodium Caprate (Figure 2), some others are comprise d of varying degrees of unsaturation ( alkenes; e.g., Oleic Acid: 1, \nLinoleic Acid: 2, and Linolenic Acid: 3 ) and/or branching (e.g., Methyl Myristic Acid ).  Table 3 lists the parent fatty acid \ningredients by increasing carbon chain length, for the straight chain alkanes and alkenes .   \n \nPhysical  and Chemical  Properties  \n The available physical and chemical properties of many of the fatty acids in this report are found in Table 4.  \nGenerally , as alkyl chain lengths incre ase in fatty acids, melting points and boiling points increase , while water solubility and \nvapor pressure decrease.36  Additionally, within a given carbon chain length, me lting point s increase with increasing saturation \nand decrease with increasing unsaturation.   Unsaturation, especially two or more double bonds, increases the rates of fatty acid \nauto-oxidation, which yields  hydroperoxides and other oxidation products.37 \n  \nMethod of Manufacturing  \nMost f atty acids occur naturally in animal and plant biochemistry, including synthesis in tissues such as the skin.38  \nFatty acids are usually produced by the hydrolysis of common animal and vegetable fats and oils followed by fractionation of \nthe resulting fatty acids.8  Fatty acids that are used in foods, drugs , and cosmetics normally exist as mixtures of several fatty \nacids , and the actual composition is dependent on the source of the acid  and manufacturing process.   \n \nLauric Acid  \nLauri c Acid is produced by the hydrolysis,  usually via saponification, of animal or vegetable fats and oils followed by \nfractional distillation.8  Lauri c Acid is commonly isolated from coconut oil,  and several patents de scribe its chemical synthesis . \n \nMyristic Acid  \nThe following methods have been used in the preparation of Myristic Acid: isolation from tal l-oil fatty acids from 9 -\nketotetradecanoic acid, by electrolysis of a mixture of methyl hydrogen adipate and decanoic acid, by Maurer oxidation of \nmyristanol, and from cetanol.8  The most common means of preparation is by fractional distillation of hydrolyzed coconut oil, \npalm kernel oil, or coconut acids.  \n \nOleic Acid  \nOleic Acid is produced by the hydr olysis and fractionation (e.g., saponification and distillation) of animal or \nvegetable fats and oils .8  Preparation of Oleic Acid from animal tallow a nd olive oil has been reported.  It is also obtained as a \nby-product in the manufacture of solid Stearic and Palmitic Acids. Crude ( i.e., unpurified, unbleached) Oleic Acid of \ncommerce contains Stearic and Palmitic Ac ids in varying quantities.  \n \nPalmitic Acid  \nPalmitic Acid is produced by the hydrolysis and fractionation of palm oil, tallow oil, coconut oil, Japan w ax, Chinese \nvegetable tallow, and spermaceti.8 Fractionation is usually by distillation or crystalli zation. Palmitic Acid can also be obtained \nin the manufacturing process for Stearic Acid.  \n \nStearic Acid  \nMethods of processing for Stearic Acid include hydrolysis of tallow or hydrogenation of unsaturated fatty acids (e.g., \nOleic Acid) in cottonseed and other vegetable oils, followed by methods of isolation, such as fractional distillation or \ncrystallization .8  A successive series of pressing operations has been used to separate the liquid unsaturated fatty  acids from \nthe solid saturated fatty acids. The Palmitic Acid/Stearic Acid ratio obtained from tallow hydrolysis and triple -pressing or  \nsolvent crystallization is 55%/ 45%. Concentrations of Ste aric Acid as high as 95 -99% have been reported from the \nhydrogenation of unsaturated fatty acids.  \n \nComposition /Impurities  \nAvailable information on composition and impurities, including Food Chemicals Codex  specifications, of several of \nthe fatty acids and fatty acid salts in this report are found in Table 5.   \n \nUSE  \nCosmetic  \nThe safety of the cosmetic ingredient s included in this assessment is evaluated based on data received from the US \nFDA and the cosmetics industry on the expected use of these ingredients  in cosmetics.  Use frequencies of individual \ningredients in cosmetics are collected from manufacturers and reported by cosmetic product category in the FDA Voluntary \nCosmetic Registratio n Program (VCRP) database.  Use concentration data are submitted by the cosmetics industry  in response \nto surveys, conducted by the Personal Care Products Council (Council), of maximum reported use concentrations by product \ncategory.  \nWhile this report co mprises , in part, a number of previously- review ed ingredients, it was prioritized based on the high \nfrequency of use of a previously unreviewed ingredient, Linoleic Acid.  According to 2019  VCRP data, Linoleic Acid  has 6 81 \ntotal uses in cosmetic products ; the majority of the uses are in leave -on skin care products  (Table 6).39  Stearic Acid , a \npreviously reviewed ingredient,  has the most reported uses in this safety assessment  with a total of 6265 uses; the majority of \nthe uses are in leave -on eye makeup preparations and skin care products  (Table 7).  The reported frequency of use of this \ningredient has almost tripled  since it was last reviewed; Stearic Acid  had a total of 2133 reported uses in 2006,  the majority of \nwhich  were also in l eave-on eye makeup preparations and skin care products .9  Palmitic Acid , another previously reviewed \ningredient,  has the second greatest number of reported uses in this safety assessment with 1532 uses; the majority of the se uses \nare in leave -on eye makeup preparations and skin care products .39  Again use of this ingredient has increased significantly since \nit was last reviewed; in 2006, Palmitic Acid had a total of 132 reported uses ,  and the majority of th ose uses were in rinse -off \nproducts .9   \nThe results of t he concentration of use survey conducted in 201 6 by the Council indicate that Linoleic Acid is used at \nup to 21.8% in rinse -off skin cleansing products and at up to 3.4% in face, neck, body, and hand skin care products.2  Sodium \nLaurate/Lin oleate/ Oleate/Palmitate is u sed at up to 84.7% in bath soaps and detergents  and at up to 74.5% in leave -on baby \nproducts.2  Stearic Acid was reported to be used at up to 37.4% in rinse -off products ( bath soaps and detergents) and at up to \n21% in leave -on products  (eyebrow pencil) .  Use concentrations have slightly decreased since the last review  of Stearic Acid in \n2006, where Stearic Acid was reported to be used at up to 43% in rinse -off products (shaving cream) and 22% in leave -on \nproducts (eyeliners) .9  In 2016,  Palmitic Acid was reported to be used at up to 21% in both rinse -off and leave -on products  \n(skin cleansing preparations an d fragrance products, respectively) ;2 whereas in  2006, Palmitic Acid was reported to be used at \nup to 20% in rinse -off products (shaving cream) and 16% in leave -on products (lipsticks) , indicating a slight increase in use \nconcentration .9  Since last review ed, the highest concentration of use for Sodium Stearate in leave -on products has increased \nfrom 25% (in deodorants) to 84% (in fragrance preparations).2,3  Ingredients with no reported uses in the VCRP or by Council \nare listed in Table 8.  \n Many of the i ngredient s included  in this safety assessment may be used in products that can be incidentally ingested or \ncome into contact with mucous membranes; for example, use is reported in lipsticks , bath preparations, and bath soaps and \ndetergents .  According to concentration of use  survey data from 2016, Behenic Acid is reported to be used at up to 14% in \nlipstick and Sodium Laurate/Linoleate/Oleate/Palmitate is reported to be used at up to 84.7% in bath soaps and detergents.2  \nAdditionally, these ingredients are reported to be used in products that may come  into contact with the eyes, such as eyebrow \npencils, eyeliners, mascara, and eye shadows.  For example, Behenic Acid is reported to be used at up  to 22% in eyebrow \npencils and H ydroxystearic Acid is used at up to 14% in eyeshadows.   \nFatty acids and fatty acid salts  were reported to be used in cosmetic sprays  and powders , including skin, deodorant, \nand fragrance products , and could possibly be inhaled. For example, Stearic Acid is reported to be in face and neck sprays at up \nto 3%, Oleic Acid is reported to be in spray deodorants at up to 1.5%, and Magnesium Stearate is reported to be in face \npowders at up to 7.2%.2   In practice, 95% to 99% of the droplets/particles released from cosmetic sprays have aerodynamic \nequivalent diameters >  10 µm with propellant sprays yielding a greater fr action of droplets/particles below 10 µm compared \nwith pump sprays.40-43  Therefore, most droplets/particles incidentally inhaled from cosmetic sprays would be deposited in the \nnasopharyngeal and bronchial regions and would not be respirable (i.e., they would not enter the lungs) to any appreciable \namount.40,41  There is some evidence indicating that deodorant spray products can release substantially larger fractions of \nparticulates having aerodynamic equivalent diameters in the range considered to be respirable.40 However, the information is \nnot sufficient to determine whether significantly greater lung exposures result from the use of deodorant sprays, com pared to \nother cosmetic sprays.  Cons ervative estimates of inhalation exposures to respirable particles during the use of loose powder \ncosmetic products are 400 -fold to 1000- fold less than protective regulatory and guidance limits for inert airborne respirable \nparticles in the workplace.44-46  \nIn regulations on cosmetic products in the European Union, Aluminum Stearate, Calcium Stearate, and Magnesium \nStearate are listed on Annex IV: list of colorants allowed in cosmetic products in the EU .47  Calcium Undecylenate, Potassium \nUndecylenate, Sodium Undecylenate, and Undecylenic Acid are listed on Annex V: list of preservatives allowed in cosmetic \nproducts ; the maximum concentratio n in ready for use preparation s is restricted to 0.2% as acid.   The remaining fatty acid s and \nfatty acid salts  listed in this report are not restricted from use in any way under the rules governing cosmetic products in the \nEuropean Union.  \n  Non-Cosmetic  \n  Most of the fatty acid ingredients described in this safety assessment are components of dietary fats found in both \nplant and animal food sources.48  Linoleic Acid and Linolenic Acid are essential fatty acids for biological processes t hat must \nbe obtained from the diet as they are not synthesized in the human body.   The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) \nrecommends that the daily intake of fatty acids (as unsaturated fats) in adults should be 27 g per day based on a 2000 calori e \ndiet, and that saturated fat intake should be limited to less than 10% of daily caloric intake.  \nRegulations applicable  to the use of fatty acids and fatty acid salts  in human food, animal feed,  drugs , and pesticide s \nin the US are summarized in Table 9.  Non -cosmetic uses of the ingredients listed in this report are found in Table 10.   \nAccording to Australia’s National Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Scheme (NICNAS), the \nfollowing ingredients are not considered to pose an unreasonable risk to the health of workers and public health: Ammonium \nStearate, Arachidic Acid, Behenic Acid, Calcium Behenate, Calcium Laurate, Calcium Stearate, Erucic Acid, Hydroxystearic \nAcid, Isostearic Acid, Lauric Acid, Linoleic Acid, Linolenic Acid, Magnesium Laurate, Magnesium Palmitate, Magnesium \nStearate, Myristic Acid, Oleic Acid, Palmitic Acid, Potassium Caprylate, Potassium Castorate, Potassium Hydrogenated \nTallowate, Potassium Laurate, Potassium Oleate, Potassium Palmitate, Potassium Stearate, Potassium Tallate, Potassium Tallowate, Sodium Caprylate, Sodium Castorate, Sodium Hydrogenated Tallowate, Sodium Isostearate, Sodium Laurate, \nSodium Oleate, Sodium Palmitate, Sodium Stearate, Sodium Tallowate, Stearic Acid, and Undecylenic Acid.\n49  The remaining \nfatty acids and fatty acid salts listed in this report do not have a  NICNAS determination.  \nPotassium Caprate, Potassium Caprylate, Potassium Laurate, Potassium Linoleate, and Potassium Oleate have been \ninvestigated for use as antibacterial agents in oral care products and anti -amoeba agents in contact lens disinfectants .50,51 \n \nTOXICOKINETICS  \nDermal Penetration  \nSodium Stearate  \nSodium Stearate is absorbed through both rat and human skin.4 \n \nPenetration Enhancement  \nOleic Acid  \n The penetration enhancing ability of Oleic Acid (up to 10% in propylene glycol) has been studied for use in the \ntopical delivery  of celecoxib , lumiracoxib , and zaltoprofen .52-54  The results of these studies indicated that Oleic Acid enhances \ndermal p enetration of these drugs.  \n Sodium Caprate  \n Sodium Caprate  (100 mM; 0.2 ml/100 g bodyweight)  is reported to be an oral absorption promoter that has potential \nfor use in oral drug products containing poorly permeable molecules.\n55  \n Myristic Acid  \nMyristic Acid enhanced the der mal penetration of several drugs  (e.g.,\n bupropion and nitrendipine ).10 \n \nAbsorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion  \nFatty acids  share a common degradation pathway in which they are metabolized to acetyl -Coenzyme A ( acetyl -CoA ) \nor other key metabolites  that are  structurally similar breakdown products .36  No significant differences in metabolic clearance \nare expected between  even and odd numbered carbon chain compounds , saturated and unsaturated compounds , or branched \nchain compounds, although different reaction sequences accommodate different structures .   \n \nArachidic Acid and Palmitic Acid  \n The blood and tissue distribution of 1 -[14C]-Arachidic A cid and 9,10- [3H]-Palmitic Acid  were studied in rats.56  The \ntest materials were simultaneously injected into  the jugular vein of  fasted or fed male rats.  Arachidic Acid was found to follow \nthe same principal pathways as Palmitic Acid, although the radiolabeled Arachidic Acid disappeared more slowl y from the \nblood than radiolabeled Palmitic Acid.   Two minutes after the injection, slightly less radiolabeled Arachidic Acid than \nradiolabeled Palmitic Acid was recovered from the whole animal. In the liver, more of the esterified Arachidic Acid \nradioact ivity was present in triglycerides and less in phospholipids than that of the Palmitic Acid radioactivity.  \n \nCalcium Stearate   \nLimited absorption studies indicated that Calcium Stearate is slightly absorbed by isolated dog intestine.4 \n \nLauric Acid, Oleic Acid, Palmitic Acid, Stearic Acid  \nFatty acids are absorbed, digested, and transported in animals and humans.8 Radioactivity from labeled fatty acids \nadministered orally, intravenously,  intraperitoneally, and intraduodenally has been found in various tissues and in blood and \nlymph. β-Oxidation of the fatty acids involves serial oxidation and reduction reactions yielding acetyl -CoA.   \nHydroxystearic A cid \n In male rats fed a diet containing hydrogenated castor oil, Hydroxystearic Acid was deposited in abdominal fat, as \nwell as other body lipids, along with its metabolities (hydroxypalmitic acid, hydroxymyristic acid, and hydroxylauric acid).5  \nHydroxystearic Acid has also been detected i n the feces of 12 subjects who presumably ate a normal mixture of foods.   \n Isostearic Acid  \n Studies with rat liver homogenate suggest Isostearic Acid is readily metabolized following ingestion.\n6   \n \nTOXICOLOGICAL STUDIES  \nAcute  Toxicity Studies  \nAcute dermal and oral  studies of several fatty acid s and fatty acid salts  are summarized in Table 11.  In dermal studies \nof Capric Acid, Lithium Stearate, Stearic Acid, and Undecylenic Acid, the LD 50 values were greater than  2000 \nmg/kg/bw.23,28,30,32  The LD 50 values in oral studies of Ammonium Oleate (up to 64 ml/kg), Behenic Acid (up to 5000 mg/kg \nbw), Calcium Stearate (2000 mg/kg bw), Capric Acid (up to 5000 mg/kg bw), Caprylic Acid (up to 5000 mg/kg bw), \nIsomerized Linoleic Acid (2000 mg/kg bw), Lauric Acid (up to 10,000 mg/kg bw), Lithium Stearate (up to 5000 mg/kg bw), \nPalmitic Acid (5000 mg/kg bw), Stearic Acid (up to 6000 mg/kg bw), and Undecylenic Acid (up to 2000 mg/kg bw)  were \nabove the doses tested .20,22,23,25-30,32,35,57 \n \nLauric Acid, Oleic Acid , Palmitic Acid, Stearic Acid  \nLittle acute toxicity was observed when Oleic  Acid, Lauri c Acid , Palmitic  Acid, Myristic  Acid, or Stearic Acid, or \ncosmetic formulations containing these fatty acids at concentrations of 2.2 - 13%, were given to rats orally at  doses of 15 ,000 - \n19,000  mg/kg body weight.8  \nResults from single topical application s of Oleic Acid (at concentrations up to 50%) to the skin of mice, rabbits, and \nguinea pigs ranged from no toxicity to si gns of erythema, hyperkeratosis, and hyperplasia.8 An acute i ntradermal \nadministration to guinea pigs of up to 25% Oleic Acid resulted in local inflammation and necrosis. A formulation containing \n2.2% Palmitic Acid was considered nontoxic to rabbits  in an acute  dermal study . A single topically applied dose of 5 g/kg \ncommercial grade Stearic Acid was not toxic to rabbits.  An acute i ntradermal administration of 10 - 100 mM Stearic Acid to \nguinea pigs and rabbits resulted in mild erythema and slight induration.  \n \nAluminum Stearate, Ammonium Stearate, Lithium Stearate, Magnesium Stearate, and Sodium Stearate  \nAcute oral studies with rats showed that Aluminum  (5.0 g/kg) , Ammonium  (5.0 g/kg) , Lithium  (tested up to 15.0 g/kg, \nbut no effects at up to 3.0 g/kg) , Magnesium  (up to 10.0 g/kg) , and Sodium  (up to 5 g/kg)  Stearates  are practically nontoxic.4  \nStudies with guinea pigs demonstrated that 100% Aluminum Stearate and 100% Ammonium Stearate have a low potential for \nacute dermal toxicity.   \n \nIsostearic Acid  \nIn rats, the acute oral LD 50 of Isostearic Acid is estimated to be greater than 32 ml/kg.6  \n  \nShort -Term  and Subchronic Toxicity Studies  \nRepeated dose sho rt-term and subchronic dermal and oral  studies of several fatty acid and fatty acid salt ingredients \nare summarized in Table 12.  The no -observable -adverse effect level (NOAEL)  in a dermal study of Lithium Stearate in rats \nwas  >  1000 mg/kg bw/day for systemic effects, but the NOAEL for local effects was 100 mg/kg bw/day.28  The NOAEL s for \nBehenic Acid  (up to 1000 mg/kg bw/day) , Calcium Stearate (up to 2000 mg/kg bw/day) , and Capric Acid  (up to 1000 mg/kg \nbw/day)  were greater than or equal to the highest doses tested in oral studies.22,23,35  In oral gavage studies with Sodium \nUndecylenate, the NOAEL was <  50 mg/kg bw/day with adverse effects including dose -dependent  clinical signs of toxicity and \nadverse effects in  the forestomach s of high dose groups.32  Hepatocellular hypertrophy was observed in rats fed up to 15% \nIsomerized Safflower Acid in a proprietary blend for 90 days . An 8-week dietary study of up to 2.5% Undecylenic Acid \nreported “inhibition of growth ” in rats.57 \n \nLauric Acid, Oleic Acid, Palmitic Acid, Stearic Acid  \nNo deaths or significant gross or microscopic alterations were observed among New Zealand White  rabbits after 4 \nweeks of topical administration of product formulations containing 2.0% Stearic Acid.8  No abnormal physiological \nparameters were noted in a 13 -week derm al toxicity study in rats of 2 cosmetic product formulations containing, at most, 5% \nStearic Acid.  \nIn subchronic oral toxicity studies, Oleic  Acid, P almitic  Acid, and Stearic Acid were fed to rats in diets at \nconcentrations  ranging from 5 to 50%.8 Thrombosis, aortic atherosclerosis, anorexia, and mortality were observed. In a \nsubchronic study, no signs of toxicity were observed in chicks fed 5% dietary Stearic and Oleic Acids.    \nCalcium Stearate  \n An emulsion of Calcium Stearate in egg yolk and water applied to the skin of guinea pigs  for 14 days caused a \nsignificant decrease in body weight.4  Calcium Stearate (10 or 50 mg in 0.5 ml of saline and 0.01 ml of egg yolk) administered \nintratracheally to rats for 2  and 4 months caused varying degrees of lung pathology.  \n \nHydroxystearic Acid  \n Reduced growth rate was noted in rats fed diets containing 8.7% and 17.3% H ydroxystearic Acid, but not in rats fed \n4.3% Hydroxystearic Acid, in a 90- day subchronic oral toxicity study.5  The results of a second 90- day experiment (no \nreduction in growth rate) confirmed that the reduction in growth rate previously observed was due to the lower caloric densit y \nof diets consisting of 8.7% and 17.3% H ydroxystearic Acid.  In both expe riments, the results of hematologic and microscopic \nevaluations were unremarkable.  \n   \nChronic Toxicity Studies  \nIsomerized Safflower Acid  \n In a 36 -week dietary study of Isomerized Safflower Acid , groups of 20 male Fischer 344 rats were given either a \ncontro l diet or the same diet supplemented with 1.5% Isomerized Safflower Acid .58  Feed consumption and body weights \nmeasurements and clinical observations of toxicity were made weekly. At termination, 15 major organs from 10 animals in \neach treatment group were ex cised, weighed, and evaluated histopathologically. No clinical signs of toxicity were observed \nfrom treatment.  No treatment -related effects in feed consumption, body weight gains, or in the histopathological investigations \nwere observed. There was no sign ificant difference in hematological measurements in cardiac blood from the treated rats when \ncompared to the control animals.  \n In another dietary study, Isomerized Safflower Acid  tested given to 11 male Fischer 344 rats at 1% in semi -purified \nfeed for 18 months.  59  A control group of 10 male rats received regular diet.  The rats were observed closely for clinical signs \nof toxicity.  Body weights and feed intake were measured weekly and twice a week, respectively.  Three rats from each group \nwere randomly selected to measure body fat after 12 weeks. Clinical chemistry and hematological analyses were performed at \n72 weeks, and necropsy and histopathology performed at study end.  \n Four control and 3 treatment animals died before study completion: these animals were found to have severe chronic \nrenal disease and were observed to have either pituitary or testicular tumors.  Feed int ake was lower in the treatment group than \nin the control group, but body weight and percent body fat, while lower, were not significantly dif ferent than the control group. \nClinical chemistry and hema tology were within normal ranges for the treatment gro up except for increased blood urea nitrogen \nand cholesterol, which may be attributed to renal failure and age, respectively. No signi ficant differences were observed in \ntissue weights at necropsy.  The study authors concluded that the test material did no t cause adverse effects in rats. 59 \n \nOleic Acid  \nFeeding of 15% dietary Oleic Acid to rats in a chronic study resulted in normal growth and general health.8 \n \nCalcium Stearate  \nCalcium Stearate (10 or 50 mg in 0.5 ml of saline and 0.01ml of egg yolk) administered intratracheally to rats for 6 \nand 8 months caused varying degrees of lung pathology.  4 \n \nDEVELOPMENTAL AND REPRODUCTIVE TOXICITY (DART) STUDIES  \n Dermal and oral DART studies of several fatty acid and fatty acid salt ingredients are summarized in Table 13.  \nLithium Stearate caused no treatment -related adverse reproductive or developmental effects at doses up to 1000 mg/kg bw/day \nin dermal studies  where male rats were treated for 43 days and fe male rats were treated for 33 days until gestation day 19 .28  \nWhile non -reproductive effects were noted in parental animals in a few oral studies, no treatment -related adverse effects were \nobserved on the reproductive cy cles or development of offspring in rats exposed to Behenic Acid  (up to 1000 mg/kg/day ; \nmales were treated 42 days and females were treated ~39 days until lactation day 3 ),22 Calcium Stearate (up to 1000 \nmg/kg/day ; males wer e treated 28 days and females were treated ~39 days until lactation day 3 ),35 Capric Acid  (up to 2000 \nmg/kg/day ; females were treated up to ~33 days until lactation day 4 ),23 Caprylic Acid  (up to 1000 mg/kg/day ; females were \ntreated for up to 9 days during gestation  starting on gestation day 12) ,25,60 or Undecylenic Acid  (up to 1000 mg/kg/day ; males \nwere treated up to 28 days and females were treated up to 40 days until lactation day 4 ).32 \n Lauric Acid, Myristic Acid, Oleic Acid, Palmitic Acid, Stearic Acid  \nAlthough placental transfer of fatty acids has been documented in several species and fetal lipid metabolism has been \nstudied, no studies on the teratogenicity of Oleic, Lauri c, Palmitic, Myristic, or Stearic Acids were found.\n8 Feeding of 15% \ndietary Oleic Acid to rats in a chronic study resulted in impairment in the reproductive capacity of female rats.  Little or no \ntoxicity to s perm cells  in vitro  in whole semen samples  by serial dilutions of Oleic Acid, Palmitic Acid, and Stearic Acid were \nobserved in studies of these ingredients.9    \nMagnesium Stearate  \n When fed to fe male rabbits at 8 days post -coitus , a pharmaceutical vehicle containing 5.5% by weight Magnesium \nStearate was not teratogenic.4   \n \nHydroxystearic Acid  \n The dermal teratogenicity of two antiperspirant prototype formulations containing 7% Hydroxystearic  Acid was \nevaluated using 2 groups of 30 Charles River Crl:CD VAF/Plus female rats  on gestation days 6 through 15.5  There were no \ntest article -related or statistically significant differences in the incidence of fetal malformations or fetal developmental \nvariations between experimental and control groups.  Skin irritation reactions, however, were observed in greater than 50% of \nthe dams in both experimental groups.  No deaths were reported during the study.  \n \nGENOTOXICITY STUDIES  \n Genotoxicity studies of several fatty acid and fatty acid salt ingredients are summarized in Table 14.  In vitro  bacterial \ncell and mammalian cell assa ys were negative for genotoxicity , with and without metabolic activation,  in Ammonium Oleate \n(up to 333  µg/plate ),20 Behenic Acid (up to 5000 µg/plate),22 Calcium Stearate (up to 312.5 µg/pla te),35 Capric Acid (up to \n10,000 µg/plate),23,61 Caproic Acid (up to 10,000 µg/plate),24 Caprylic Acid (up to 3333 µg/plate),25,61 Isomerized Linoleic \nAcid (up to  2500 µg/plate),26 Isomerized Safflower Acid (up to 5000 µg/plate),62 Lauric Acid (up t o 2500 µg/plate),27,61 \nLinoleic Acid (dose not reported),63 Lithium Stearate (up to 5000 µg/plate),28 Magnesium Stearate (up to 5 000 µg/plate),64 \nMyristic Acid (dose not reported),61 and Undecylenic Acid (up to 750 µ g/plate) .32  In vivo, no genotoxicity  was detected in  a \nmouse micronucleus assay after oral exposure up to  2000 mg/kg Magnesium Stearate in 0.5% sodium carboxymethyl cellulose \nor 4000 mg/kg Undecylenic Aci d in 10% gum arabi c.32,64 \n Lauric Acid, Oleic Acid, Stearic Acid  \nAlthough Oleic Acid and Lauric Acid induced mitotic aneuploi dy in in vitro mutagenicity tests, both have been \nindicated as inhibitors of mutagenicity produced by positive controls, such as N -nitrosopyrrolidine and sodium azide, in other \ntests. Stearic Acid was inactive in aneuploidy induction tests and in the Ames test, and it did not inhibit mutagenicity, as did Oleic Acid and Lauric Acid. No increase of mitotic crossing- over events was induced by Oleic Acid, Lauric Acid, or Stearic \nAcid. Oleic Acid did not increase the number of sister chromatid exchanges over bac kground.  \n \nMagnesium Stearate  \n Magnesium Stearate (concentration tested not reported) was not mutagenic in microbial tests with Salmonella \ntyphimurium or Saccharomyces cerevisiae.\n4  \n  \nHydroxystearic Acid  \n Hydroxystearic Acid was not mutagenic in S. typhimurium strainsTA1535, TA100, TA1537, TA1538, and TA98.5  \nHowever, Hydroxystearic Acid was  classified as mutagenic in Escherichia coli strain Hs30.  Hydroxystearic Acid was not \nmutagenic in the L5178Y TK +/ - mouse lymphoma assay, with or without metabolic activation, nor did it produce chromosome \naberrations in Chinese hamster ovary cells, with or without metabolic activation.  \n \nCARCINOGENICITY STUDIES  \nSodium Oleate  \n In a 108- week drinking water study , groups of 50 ma le and 50 female F344 rats received 0%, 2.5%, or 5.0% Sodium \nOleate.65  Water consumption was recorded twice weekly and the rats were weighed every two or four weeks.  Blood and urine \nsamples were taken from 10 rats per sex per dose group prior to study termination for biochemical and hematological anal yses.  \nA necropsy was performed at study termination to examine for tumors or other lesions in the major organs and tissues.  \nSurvival rates for the treated rats were comparable to the controls.  While there was a slight reduction in body weight \ngains in m ale rats, there were no significant differ ences in growth curve  of treated and control rats of either sex.  Water \nconsumption was slightly , but not significantly,  depressed in both female treatment groups .  The mean liver weight in the 5% \nmale test group w as statistically significantly  lower than that of the males in the control and 2.5% test group.  The mean \nthymus weight in the 5% female test group was statistically significantly higher than that of the females in the control and 2.5% \ntest group.  No statistically significant differences were observed between the treated rats of either sex and the control rats in \nthe results of urine and serum analyses, hematology parameters , or in tumor incidences, except for pancreatic tumors.  An \nincrease in the inciden ce of pancreatic tumors was observed in both male dose groups when compared to the control group, but \nthese were not significantly different from reported spontaneous incidences of these tumors in this strain of rat.  The autho rs \nconcluded that Sodium Olea te did not induce tumors in this drinking water study in rats.65 \n Lauric Acid, Oleic Acid, Palmitic Acid, Stearic Acid  \nIn carcinogenicity studies, no malignant tumors were induced by repeated subcutaneous injections of 1 - 16.5 mg \nOleic Acid in two strains of mice. Intestinal and gastric tumors were found in mice receiving dietary Oleic Acid at daily dose s \nup to 200 mg/mouse. Treatment of mice with repeated subcutaneous inje ctions of 25 and 50 mg Lauri c Acid was not \ncarcinogenic. Low incidences of carcinomas, sarcomas, and lymphomas were observed in mice receiving single or repeated \nsubcutaneous injections of 25 and 50 mg Palmitic  Acid and up to 82 mg Stearic Acid. Feeding of  up to 50 g/kg/day dietary \nStearic Acid to mice was not carcinogenic  (duration not reported) . \n \nMagnesium Stearate  \n Mice surviving 30 -week implants of Magnesium Stearate pellets in the bladder had a bladder tumor incidence of \n5.0%, but the incidence was no different than that caused by glass beads.  \n \nHydroxystearic Acid  \n In an 18- month carcinogenicity study (subcutaneous study), Hydroxystearic Acid was classified as tentatively \ncarcinogenic in Swiss -Webster mice.5  Subcutaneous sarcomas were observed at the site of injection in 9 of the 28 mi ce (14 per \ndose group) that were alive at 6 months.  All of the sarcomas were observed in the low -dose group (total dose of 4 mg \ndelivered in a total of 8 ml tricaprylin for 80 weeks).  The high- dose group received a total dose of 80 mg delivered in a total of \n8 ml of tricaprylin.  In a second study in which 9 A/He male mice received a total intraperitoneal dose of 60 mg Hydroxystear ic \nAcid over a period of 4 weeks, the frequency of lung tumors was within the spontaneous occurrence.  \n \nOTHER RELEVANT STUDIES  \nComedogenicity  \nOleic Acid  \nOleic Acid  (99%)  and its UVA -induced peroxides were associated with increased comedo formation on the treated \nears of two species of rabbits.8 \n \nIsostearic Acid  \nA product formulation both with and without 2.5% Isostearic Acid was tested in a rabbit ear comedogenicity assay.  \nThe formulation without Isostearic Acid was irritating but did not produc e comedones; however, the formulation with \nIsostearic Acid was both irritating and comedogenic.  \n \nHepatotoxicity  \nHydroxystearic Acid  \nIn an in vitro stu dy, Hydroxystearic Acid (30 µM) interfered with oxidative phosphorylation in rat liver \nmitochondria.5  Oxidative phosphorylation was uncouple d and mitochondria were damaged.   \n \nDERMAL IRRITATION AN D SENSITIZATION STUD IES  \nDermal irritation and sensitization studies of several fatty acid and fatty acid salt ingredients are summarized in Table \n15. Several in vitro assays and animal irritation studies indicate that Caproic Acid  and Caprylic Acid  are corrosive at \nconcentrations of 70% and 99%, respectively , and Capric Acid (concentratio n not reported) Isostearic Acid  (tested at 100%) , \nLauric Acid  (concentration not reported) , Trilinoleic Acid  (concentration not reported) , and Undecylenic Acid (concentration \nnot reported)  may be irritating.20,24,25,27,29,31,66-70  Aluminum Triste arate, Lauric Acid, Lithium Stearate, however, were predicted \nto be not  irritating and/or corrosive in human epidermis models.21,28,70 In human irritation studies, Lauric Acid at 50% induced \nerythema, edema, and scaling in a closed epicutaneous test; however, only slight erythema was observed in an open \nepicutaneous test of Lauric Acid at 80%.27  No dermal irritation was observed in subjects exposed to Palmitic Acid at 50%.29   \nIn chemico  direct peptide reactivity assays (DPRAs) predicted that Linoleic Acid (100 mM) and Linolenic Acid (100 \nmM) were skin sensitizers, while Oleic Acid (100 mM) and Undecylenic Acid (100 mM) were not.71 In local lymph node \nassays ( LLNA s) and modified LLNAs , Lithium Stearate (up to 10%) was not sensitizing; however, the results of tests with \nAmmonium Oleate (up to 50%) , Hydroxystearic Acid (u p to 50% ); Linoleic Acid (25%), Linolenic Acid (25%), Oleic Acid \n(10%), and Undecylenic Acid (25%)  indicate that these ingredients may induce sensitization.20,28,33,71  In guinea pig studies, \nreactions observed to Ammonium Oleate (up to 50%) and Hydroxystearic Acid (up to 10%) may have been due to \nirritation.20,33  No sensitization was observed in guinea pig studies with Capric Acid (up to 40%), Lauric Acid (up to 2.5%), \nSodium Undecylenate (up to 0.1%), Trilinoleic Acid (up to 75%), or Undecyleni c Acid (up to 100%).23,27,31,32 \n \nLauric Acid, Oleic Acid, Palmitic Acid, Myristic Acid, and Stearic Acid  \nIn single insult occlusive patch tests for primary irritation, Stearic Acid  at concentrations  of 35 - 65% in vehicles  and  \nLauric, Oleic, Palmitic, and Myristic Acids  at 1 - 13% in cosmetic product formulations  produced no to moderate erythema \nand slight,  if any, edema in the skin of rabbits.8 Slight increases in irritation were observed in rabbits in short -term repeated patch tests (daily for 3  - 14 days) of Oleic  Acid (5%)  and Myristic Acid  (concentration not reported) . Approximately 5% (w/v; \n18 mmol%) alcohol solution of the fatty acids topically applied to the skin of the external ear canals of albino rabbits for 6 \nweeks produced a range of responses, varying from no irritation with Stearic Acid to slight  irritation with Myristic Acid and \nPalmitic Acid to defined erythema, desquamation, and persistent follicular keratosis with Oleic Acid and Lauric Acid. Slight \nlocal edema was observed among New Zealand White rabbits after 4 weeks of topical administration of product formulations \ncontaining 2.0% Stearic Acid. In 13 -week dermal toxicity studies, 2 cosmetic product formulations containing, at most, 5% \nStearic Acid produced moderate skin irritation in rats receiving 4.0 ml/kg and 227 mg/kg doses.  \nIn guinea pi g maximization studies with 2 cosmetic product formulations containing 5.08% Oleic Acid and 1.0% \nStearic Acid, slight reactions were observed to challenge patches.8 These formulations were considered weak, grade 1, \nsensitizers . In another maximization study, after intradermal induction and booster injections of a formulation containing 3.5% \nStearic Acid, reactions to topical challenge applications of the formulation were few and minimal in intensity.   \nIn clinical primary and cumulative irritation studies, 50% Oleic Acid, 50% Myristic Acid, and 40% Stearic Acid in \nmineral oil were nonirritating.8 Mild to intense erythema in single insult occlusive patch te sts, soap chamber tests, and 21 -day \ncumulative irritation studies were produced by cosmetic product formulations containing Oleic  Acid (up to 30%) , Palmitic  \nAcid (2.2%) , Myristic  Acid (up to 8%) , or Stearic Acid  (up to 13%) . In clinical repeated insult pat ch tests (open, occlusive, and \nsemi-occlusive), maximization tests, and prophetic patch tests with cosmetic product formulations containing Oleic  Acid, \nLauri c Acid , Palmitic  Acid, and Stearic Acid at concentrations ranging from < 1 to 13%, no primary or cumulative irritation \nor sensitization was reported. Slight, if any, reactions were observed after challenge patching at original or adjacent sites  on \nthe upper backs or forearms of some subjects ( approximately  < 2%). Intensity of observed reactions to the f ormulations was \nnot directly related to the concentrations of the fatty acid ingredients.  \n \nMyristic Acid  \nMyristic Acid (concentration not reported) was non- irritating in a single insult occlusive patch test and slightly \nirritating in a repeat open patch test on rabbits.8,10  In clinical primary and cumul ative irritation studies, Myris tic Acid at up to \n50% was nonirritating.  \n \nAluminum Distearate, Ammonium Stearate, Magnesium Stearate, and Sodium Stearate   \nSkin irritation studies with rabbits demonstrated that 10% Aluminum Distearate  in corn oil and 100% Ammonium \nStearate were minimal and slight irritants, respectively, whereas 100% Magnesium Stearate and Sodium Stearate were non-\nirritating.4  When tested on rabbit skin at concentrations of 100%,  Magnesium Stearate was found to be noncorrosive.  In \nhuman studies, 7 out of 20 subjects exhibited minimal to mild skin erythema when tested with an aqueous solution of 1.5% \nAmmonium Stearate in a single -insult, 24 h patch test.  In a similar study with 0.5% Sodium Stearate in aqueous solution, 4 out \nof 20 subjects demonstrated minimal to moderate skin erythema.  In a 21 day patch test with 10 subjects, an aqueous bath soap \nand detergent solution containing 0.1% to 0.25% Sodium Stearate caused minimal skin irritation.  An aqueous solution of the \nsame formulation containing 0.3% to 0.75% Sodium Stearate caused no sensitization in 100 subjects.  A stick deodorant \ncontaining 7% Sodium Stearate demonstrated low potential for human skin irritation and sensitizat ion. \n \nHydroxystearic Acid  \n Skin irritation reactions to each of 3 antiperspirant prototype formulations, each containing 7% Hydroxystearic Acid, \nwere observed in a human primary irritation patch test using 35 volunteers.5  Semi -occluded patches produced reactions in as \nmany as 9 of the subj ects, whereas occluded patches produced reactions in as many as 17 individuals.  Only 2 reactions were \nnoted in the semi -occluded patch controls and only 1 in the occluded patch controls.  Although the formulations reportedly \ncontained the same concentrati on of Hydroxystearic Acid, there were small differences in the numbers of individuals reacting \nto each.  \n \nIsostearic Acid  \n Isostearic Acid at up to 100%  produced no significant skin irritation in Draize rabbit irritation tests, whereas \nvariable degrees of irritation were produced by product formulations containing up to 35%  Isostearic Acid.6  In clinical \nstudies, 100 subjects showed no signs of irritation after a 24 h single insult skin patch with undiluted Isostearic Acid, and  \nproduct formulations containing up to 4% Isostearic Acid produced, at most, minimal irritation when similarly tested on a total \nof 221 subjects.  In another study, 35% Isostearic Acid in mineral oil was neither an irritant nor a sensitizer in 168 subjec ts.  \nIsostearic Acid at 10% in mineral oil was similarly not irritating or sensitizing to 103 sub jects.  Product formulations \ncontaining 2.5% to 2.85% Isostearic Acid produced no evidence of contact sensitization when tested in repeated insult patch \ntests on a total of 333 subjects.  \n     PHOTOTOXICITY AND PH OTOSENSITIZATION  \nIn Vitro  \nLauric Acid and Sodium Laurate  \n In a validation study of the in vitro reactive oxygen species (ROS) assay and the 3T3 neutral red uptake phototoxicity \ntest (3T3 NRU PT), Lauric Acid and Sodium Laurate were not predicted to cause phototoxicity or photoallergy.72  These \nfindings were supported by the results of an ultraviolet/visible light (UV/VIS) spectral analysis.  \n \nAnimal  \nStearic Acid  \nSkin lotion formulations containing 2.8% Stearic Acid were not photosensitizing to the skin of Hartley guinea pigs.8 \n \nHuman  \nLinoleic Acid  \n In a study to evaluate  skin response to UV following exposure to lipid ingredien ts in moisturizers, human volunteers \nreceived a 20 µ l aliquot of 20 mg/ml Linoleic Acid dissolved in octyldodecanol on tape -stripped buttock skin.73  The test sites \nwere occluded. Two days after application of the test material, the areas were irradiated  with UV (Waldmann UV800 \nphototherapy device and a Philips TL -20W/23 fluorescent sun lamp with emission spectrum between 285 and 350 nm ; mid- to \nlong-wavelength UV (UVB and UVA, respectively) ) and  skin samples were obtained 24 hours later.  The histologic features \nand expression of markers of collagen metabolism and inflammatory mediators were evaluated.  When compared to the vehicle, Linoleic Acid increased the induction of apoptotic cells and the expression of MMP - and IL -6 mRNA.  The authors \nconcluded that topical Linoleic Acid followed by UV exposure has the potential to aggravate damaged skin.    \n Oleic Acid, Palmitic Acid, Stearic Acid  \nCosmetic product formulations containing 1 -  13% Oleic Acid , Palmitic Acid, or Stearic Acid produced no \nphotosensitization in human subjects. \n8 There were slight reactions to a few induction patches.  \n \nIsostearic Acid  \n In a subset population of 25 individuals in an i rritation and sensitization study in humans, 35% Isostearic Acid in \nmineral oil with exposure to UVA + UVB was not a photosensitizer.6   \n \nOCULAR IRRITATION ST UDIES  \nOcular irritation studies for several fatty acid and fatty acid salt ingredients are summarized in Table 16.  Caproic \nAcid at 50% was corrosive in bovine corneas, but Lithium Stearate (concentration not reported) was predicted to be non -\nirritating in a human corneal model.24,28  In rabbits, Caproic Acid (concentration not reported), Caprylic Acid (70%), Lauric \nAcid ( up to 100% ), Lithium Stearate (concentration not reported), Stearic Acid (iso -form; 100%), Sodium Undecylenate \n(33.2%), and Undecylenic  Acid (concentration not reported) were mild to moderate ocular irritants .23-25,27,28,32,74   Oleic Acid (at \nup to 0.1%) and Palmitic Acid (concentration not reported) w ere not ocular irritants .29,75  \n \nLauric Acid, Oleic Acid, Palmitic Acid, Myristic Acid, and Stearic Acid  \nIn ocular irritation studies, Oleic Acid, Lauric  Acid, Palmitic Acid, Myristic Acid, and Stearic Acid neat and at \nconcentrations ranging from 1 to 19.4% in cosmetic product formulations produced no to minimal irritation after single and \nmultiple (daily, 14 -day) instillations into the eyes of albino rabbits.8,10 Irritation was pri marily in the form of very slight \nconjunctival erythema. A single instillation of Lauri c Acid also produced cornea1 opacity and iritis. In humans, t here was no \ntreatment- related ocular irritation in female subjects, some of whom were contact lens wearers, involved in two 3- week \nexaggerated -use studies of mascara formulations containing 2%  and 3% Oleic Acid. These formulations were used in \ncombination with other eye area cosmetics.   Myristic Acid in product formulations at a concentration of 1.5% was minimally \nirritating to the eyes of rabbits.  \n \n Aluminum Distearate , Ammonium Stearate , and Magnesium Stearate  \nEye irritation studies with rabbits showed that 10% Aluminum Distearate in corn oil and undiluted Ammonium \nStearate and Sodium Stearate were minimal to mild irritants; 100% Magnesium Stearate was non- irritating.4  \n \nIsostearic Acid  \nUndiluted Isostearic Acid produced no significant eye irritation in Draize rabbit irritation tests, whereas variable \ndegrees of irritation were produced by product formulations containing Isostearic Acid.6 \n CLINICAL STUDIES  \nCase Reports  \nHydroxystearic Acid  \nA patient presented with pruritic edematous erythema and scaling on the lips, and positive patch test reactions were \nreported with three of her lip gloss formulations.76 Subsequent patch tests were performed with 21 lip gloss ingredients, and \nonly Hydroxystearic Acid and C18 -36 acid triglyceride, both tested at 10% in petrolatum and both present in all three lip gloss \nformulations, produced positive reactions (+ reaction on day 2 and day 3).  Patch tests of these substances in 6 control subjects \nwere negative.  \nIn another case report, a patient presented with severe contact dermatitis from a lip balm and from a solid -stick \nunderarm anti perspirant/deodorant.77  Patch testing with ingredients from the lip balm resulted in positive results at 10% \nHydroxy stearic Acid in petrolatum.  Subsequent patch testing with serial dilutions of H ydroxystearic Acid (99.7% pure) were \npositive to 0.001% in petrolatum.   (A patch test with hydrogenated castor oil, an ingredient present in  the deodorant \nformulation, was positive at 1% in petrolatum.)  \n \nUndecylenic Acid and Potassium Undecylenate  \n A 52 -year-old white male patient presented  with intermittent scaling and itching between the toes following \napplication of a therapeutic topical cr eam containing 10% U ndecylenic Acid as free acid and potassium salt on two consecutive \ndays.78  On the third day, the dorsa of the feet became erythematous, edematous, and exudative.  When application of the cream \nwas halted, gradual healing occurred with local therapy.  Slight residual  erythema and fissuring at the base  of the left third toe \nwas apparent on day 10 post -application.  When the patient resumed use of the cream on his feet, marked erythema, edema, \nand pruritus occurred within 24 h on the toes and dorsa of the feet.  Pruritu s and lesions disappeared three weeks after the \nsecond discontinuation of the cream.  Patch tests with materials from the patient’s shoes were negative.  Marked positive reactions were observed to the topical cream and a similar powder formulation.  Patch tests with Potassium Undecylenate gave \na marked positive reaction, but reactions to other preparations containing U ndecylenic Acid, zinc undecylenate, copper \nundecylenate, potassium chloride, and potassium permanganate were negative  \n \nSUMMARY  \nMost of the 102 fatty acids and fatty acid salts  detailed in this safety assessment are reported to function as anticaking \nagents, emulsion stabilizers, viscosity increasing agents, opacifying agents, and surfactants . Additional functions included hair \nand skin condit ioning agents, binders, slip modifier, antioxidants, fragrance ingredients, colorants, skin protectants, cosmetic \nbiocide, and film formers.  While some of these ingredients have not been previously review by the Panel , such as Linoleic \nAcid, several previo usly assessed ingredients have been included herein as they fit within this grouping of fatty acids and salts \nand can be appropriately re -reviewed herewith. Each of the ingredients in this report comprises a carboxylic acid functional \ngroup and an aliphati c (fatty) chain.  \nMost of the fatty acid ingredients described in this safety assessment are ubiquitous in food as components of dietary \nfats. The US FDA determined that several of the fatty acids and salts of fatty acids are approved as food additives permitted for direct addition to food for human consumption . Daily consumption of these ingredients  would result in much larger systemic \nexposures than what is expected from use in cosmetic products, even if there was 100% absorption. A sampling of the sys temic \ntoxicity via oral exposure has been included in this report; however, the primary focus of the safety assessment is the revie w of \nsafety based on topical exposure  and local effects . \nFatty acids occur naturally in animal and plant biochemistry, includ ing synthesis in tissues such as the skin.  Fatty \nacids are usually produced by the hydrolysis of common animal and vegetable fats and oils followed by fractionation of the \nresulting fatty acids.  Fatty acids that are used in foods, drugs , and cosmetics , normally exist as mixtures of several fatty acids \ndepending on the source and manufacturing process.   \nAccording to 2019  VCRP data, Linoleic Acid has 681 total uses in cosmetic products; the majority of the se uses is in \nleave -on skin care products.  Stearic  Acid , a previously reviewed ingredient,  has the most reported uses in this safety \nassessment  with a total of 6265; the majority of the se uses are in leave -on eye makeup preparations and skin care products .  \nThis ingredient had a total of 2133 reported use s in 2006; the majority of the uses were also in leave -on eye makeup \npreparations and skin care products.  Palmitic Acid , another previously reviewed ingredient,  had the second greatest number of \nreported uses  in this safety assessment  with 1532; the major ity of the uses were  in leave -on eye makeup preparations and skin \ncare products.  In 2006, Palmitic Acid had a total of 132 reported uses; the majority of the uses were in rinse -off products such \nas shampoos, shaving products, and personal cleanliness products.   \nThe results of the concentration of use survey conducted in 2016 by t he Council indicate that Linoleic Acid is used at \nup to 21.8% in rinse -off skin cleansing products and at up to 3.4% in face, neck, body, and hand skin care products.  Sodium \nLaur ate/Linoleate/Oleate/Palmitate is used at up to 84.7% in bath soaps and detergents and at up to 74.5% in leave -on baby \nproducts.   Stearic Acid is  reported to be used at up to 37.4% in rinse -off products (bath soaps and detergents) and at up to 21% \nin leave -on products (eyebrow pencil); Palmitic Acid is  reported to be used at up to 21% in both rinse -off and leave -on \nproducts (skin cleansing preparations and fragrance products, respectively).  In 2006, Stearic Acid was reported to be used at up to 43% in rins e-off products (shaving cream) and 22% in leave -on products (eyeliners); and Palmitic Acid was reported to \nbe used at up to 20% in rinse -off products (shaving cream) and 16% in leave -on products (lipsticks).  \nFatty acids share a common degradation pathway in which they are metabolized to acetyl -CoA or other key \nmetabolites that are structurally similar breakdown products.  No differences in metabolism are expected between even and odd  \nnumbered carbon chain compounds or saturated and unsaturated compounds.   \nIn dermal studies of Capric Acid, Lithium Stearate, Stearic Acid, and Undecylenic Acid, the LD 50 values were greater \nthan 2000 mg/kg/bw . The  LD 50 values in oral studies of numerous fatty acid and fatty acid salt ingredients were above the \ndoses tested.  \nThe NOAEL in a dermal study of Lithium Stearate in rats was >  1000 mg/kg bw/day for systemic effects, but the \nNOAEL for local effects was 100 mg/kg bw/day .  The NOAEL s for Behenic Acid, Calcium Stearate, and Capric Acid were  \ngreater than or equal to the hi ghest doses tested in oral studies .  In oral gavage studies with Sodium Undecylenate, the NOAEL \nwas < 50 mg/kg bw/day with adverse effects including dose -dependent clinical signs of toxicity and adv erse effects in the \nforestomach s of high dose groups.  A n 8-week  dietary study of up to 2.5% Undecylenic Acid reported “inhibition of growth ” in \nrats. Isomerized Safflower Acid  tested at 1% and 1.5% in feed for 18 and 9 months , respectively,  did not cause adverse effects \nin rats, but hepatocellular hypertrophy wa s observed in rats feed up to 15% in a proprietary blend in a 90- day study.   \nLithium Stearate caused no treatment -related adverse reproductive or developmental effects at doses up to 1000 mg/kg \nbw/day in dermal studies.  While non -reproductive effects were noted in parental animals in a few oral studies, no treatment -\nrelated adverse effects were observed on the reproductive cycles or development of offspring in rats exposed to Behenic Acid  \n(up to 1000 mg/kg/day) , Calcium Stearate (up to 1000 mg/kg/day) , Cap ric Acid  (up to 2000 mg/kg/day) , Caprylic Acid  (up to \n1000 mg/kg/day) , or Undecylenic Acid  (up to 1000 mg/kg/day) . \nIn vitro bacterial cell and mammalian cell assays were negative for genotoxicity in Ammonium Oleate, Behenic Acid, \nCalcium Stearate, Capric A cid, Caproic Acid, Caprylic Acid, Isomerized Linoleic Acid, Isomerized Safflower Acid, Lauric \nAcid, Linoleic Acid, Lithium Stearate, Magnesium Stearate, Myristic Acid, and Undecylenic Acid .  No genotoxicity was \ndetected in a micronucleus assay in mice with  Undecylenic Acid.  \nSeveral in vitro assays and animal irritation studies indicate that Caproic Acid and Caprylic Acid are corrosive at \nconcentrations of 70% and 99%, respectively, and Capric Acid (concentration not reported), Isostearic Acid (100%), Lauric \nAcid (concentration not reported), Trilinoleic Acid (concentration not reported) , and Undecylenic Acid (concentration not \nreported)  may be irritating.   Aluminum Triste arate, Lauric Acid,  and Lithium Stearate, however, were predicted to be not \nirrita ting and/or c orrosive human epidermis models. In  human irritation studies, Lauric Acid at 50% induced erythema, edema, \nand scaling in a closed epicutaneous test; however, only slight erythema was observed in an open epicutaneous test of Lauric \nAcid at 80%.  No dermal irritation was observed in subjects  exposed to Palmitic Acid at 50%.   \nIn chemico DPRAs  predicted that Linoleic Acid (100 mM) and Linolenic Acid (100 mM) were skin sensitizers, while \nOleic Acid (100 mM) and Undecylenic Acid (100 mM) were not .  In LLNA s, Lithium Stearate (up to 10%) was not \nsensitizing; however, the results of tests with Hydroxystearic Acid (up to 50%) and Ammonium Oleate (up to 50%) indicate that these ingredients may induce sensitization.  In guinea pig studies, reactions observed to Ammonium Oleate (up to 50%) \nand Hydroxystearic Acid (up to 10%) may have been due to irritation. No sensitization was observed in guinea pig studies with  \nCapric Acid (up to 40%), Lauric Acid (up to 2.5%), Sodium Undecylenate (up to 0.1%), Trilinoleic  Acid (up to 75%), or \nUndecylenic Acid (up to 100%) .  \nLauric Acid and Sodium Laurate were not predicted to cause phototoxicity or photoallergy in in vitro assays.  In \nhuman studies, topical application of Linoleic Acid followed by UV exposure was determine d to have the potential to \naggravate damaged skin.  \nCaproic Acid at 50% was corrosive in bovine corneas, but Lithium Stearate (concentration not reported) was predicted \nto be non -irritating in a human corneal model. In rabbits, Caproic Acid (concentration n ot reported), Caprylic Acid (70%), \nLauric Acid (concentration not reported), Lithium Stearate (concentration not reported), and Undecylenic Acid (concentration \nnot reported) were ocular irritants of varying severity. Oleic Acid (up to 0.1%) and Palmitic Ac id (concentration not reported) \nwere  not ocular irritants .  \nCase reports of reactions to Hydroxystearic Acid in lip products and deodorants and to Potassium Undecylenate in a \ntopical cream have been reported.  \n \nDISCUSSION  \nEach of the ingredients in this rep ort comprises a carboxylic acid functional group and an aliphatic (fatty) chain. M ost \nof the fatty acids (such as Linoleic Acid ) and fatty acid salts have not been previously reviewed by the Panel .  However , \nseveral previously assessed ingredients are included in this report as they fit within this grouping of fatty acids and salts , and \npertinent data from the previous reports were considered by the Panel.  \nThe Panel acknowledged that some of the fatty acids and fatty acid salts  may be formed from plant -derived or animal -\nderived constituents. The Panel thus expressed concern regarding pesticide residues and heavy metal that may be present in botanical ingredients. They stressed that the cosmetics industry should continue to use the necessary procedures t o sufficiently \nlimit amounts of such impurities in an ingredient before blending them into cosmetic formulations. Additionally, the Panel considered the risks inherent in using animal -derived ingredients, namely the transmission of infectious agents. While  tallow \nmay be used in the manufacture of some ingredients in this safety assessment and is clearly animal -derived, the Panel notes that tallow is highly processed, and tallow derivatives even more so. The Panel agrees with determinations by the U S FDA tha t \ntallow derivatives are not risk materials for transmission of infectious agents.  \nThe Panel also recognized that these ingredients, particularly Myristic Acid, Oleic Acid, and Sodium Caprate, can \nenhance the penetration of other ingredients through the skin. The Panel cautioned that care should be taken in formulating \ncosmetic products that may contain these ingredients in combination with any ingredients whose safety was based on their lack  \nof dermal absorption data, or when dermal absorption was otherwis e a concern.  \nThe Panel was concerned that the potential exists for dermal irritation with the use of products formulated using fatty \nacids and fatty acid salts. The Panel specified that products containing fatty acids and fatty acid salts must be formulated to be \nnon-irritating.  The Panel was also concerned about the potential for polyunsaturated fatty acids to undergo oxidation during \nthe formulation, or storage of cosmetic products, that may produce compounds that are dermal sensitizers.  The Panel advis es \nindustry to limit oxidative products in formulations containing fatty acids and fatty acid salts, and to utilize accepted \nmethodologies, such as a QRA, to ensure formulations are non- sensitizing.   \nFatty acids and fatty acid salts were reported to be us ed in spray and powder products that could possibly be inhaled.  \nFor example, Stearic Acid is reported to be in face and neck sprays at up to 3%, Oleic Acid is reported to be in spray \ndeodorants at up to 1.5%, and Magnesium Stearate is reported to be in fa ce powders at up to 7.2%.  There were no inhalation \ntoxicity data available.  Although the Panel noted that droplets/particles from spray and loose -powder cosmetic products would \nnot be respirable to any appreciable amount, the potential for inhalation tox icity is not limited to respirable droplets/particles \ndeposited in the lungs.  In principle, inhaled droplets/particles deposited in the nasopharyngeal and thoracic regions of the  \nrespiratory tract may cause toxic effects depending on their chemical and ot her properties.  However, coupled with the small \nactual exposure in the breathing zone and the concentrations at which the ingredients are used, the available information indicates that incidental inhalation would not be a significant route of exposure tha t might lead to local respiratory or systemic \neffects. A detailed discussion and summary of the Panel’s approach to evaluating incidental inhalation exposures to ingredien ts \nin cosmetic products is available at https://www.cir -safety.org/cir -findings\n.  \n \nCONCLUSION  \nThe CIR Expert Panel concluded  that the following ingredients are safe in the present practices of use and \nconcentration described in the safety assessment when formulated to be non -irritating and non -sensitizi ng, which may be based \non a QRA.  \n \nAluminum Dilinoleate*  \nAluminum Distearate  \nAluminum Isostearate*  \nAluminum Isostearates/Palmitates*  \nAluminum Isostearates/Stearates*  \nAluminum Isostearates/Laurates/Palmitates*  \nAluminum Isostearates/Laurates/Stearates*  \nAluminum Lanolate*  \nAluminum Stearate  \nAluminum Stearates  \nAlumin um Tristearate  \nAmmonium Isostearate*  \nAmmonium Oleate*  \nAmmonium Stearate  \nArachidic Acid  \nBeeswax Acid*  \nBehenic Acid  \nC14-28 Alkyl Acid  \nC10-40 Isoalkyl Acid \nC14-28 Isoalkyl Acid  \nC32-36 Isoalkyl Acid*  \nCalcium Behenate  \nCalcium Laurate*  \nCalcium Stearate  \nCalcium Undecylenate*  \nCapric Acid  \nCaproic Acid  \nCaprylic Acid  Dilinoleic Acid  \nDierucic Acid*   \nEicosatrienoic Acid*  Erucic Acid*  \nHydroxycapric Acid  Hydroxycaprylic Acid  \n10-Hydroxydecanoic Acid  \nHydroxylauric Acid*  \nHydroxystearic Acid  \n10-Hydroxystearic  Acid*  \nIsomerized Linoleic Acid  Isomerized Safflower Acid*  \nIsostearic Acid  \nLauric Acid  \nLinoleic Acid  \nLinolenic Acid  \nLithium Stearate  Magnesium Lanolate*  \nMagnesium Laurate  \nMagnesium Palmitate*  \nMagnesium Stearate  Magnesium Tallowate*  \nMyristic Acid  \nMethyl Myristic Acid*   \nOleic Acid  Palmitic Acid  \nPotassium Behenate  Potassium Borageate*  \nPotassium Camelliate*  \nPotassium Caprate*  \nPotassium Caprylate*  \nPotassium Caprylate/Caprate*  \nPotassium Castorate  Potassium Hydrogenated Tallowate  Potassium Hydroxys tearate*  \nPotassium Isostearate  \nPotassium Lanolate*  \nPotassium Laurate  \nPotassium Linoleate*  \nPotassium Linseedate*  \nPotassium Oleate  \nPotassium Olivate/Sunflowerseedate*  \nPotassium Palmitate  \nPotassium Stearate  \nPotassium Sunflowerseedate*  \nPotassium Tallate  \nPotassium Tallowate  \nPotassium Undecylenate*  \nSodium Arganate*  \nSodium Beeswax* \nSodium Behenate  \nSodium Camellia Japonica Seedate*  \nSodium Caprate*  \nSodium Caprylate* Sodium Castorate  \nSodium Dilinoleate*  \nSodium Hydrogenated Tallowate*  \nSodium Hydroxystearate* \nSodium Isostearate  \nSodium Lanolate*  \nSodium Lardate*  \nSodium Laurate  \nSodium Laurate/Linoleate/Oleate/Palmitate  \nSodium Linoleate* \nSodium Oleate  \nSodium Palmitate  \nSodium Stearate  \nSodium Tallowate  \nSodium Tamanuseedate*  \nSodium Undecylenate  \nStearic Acid  Trilinoleic Acid  \nUndecanoic Acid  \nUndecylenic Acid  \n \n*Not reported to be in current use.

Bergfeld, MD, FACP2,\nDonald V. Belsito, MD2, Ronald A. Hill, PhD2, Curtis D. Klaassen, PhD2,\nJames G. Marks Jr, MD2, Ronald C. Shank, PhD2, Thomas J. Slaga, PhD2,\nPaul W. Snyder, DVM, PhD2, and F. Alan Andersen, PhD3\nAbstract\nSodium laureth sulfate is a member of a group of salts of sulfated ethoxylated alcohols, the safety of which was evaluated by the\nCosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) Expert Panel for use in cosmetics. Sodium and ammonium laureth sulfate have not evoked\nadverse responses in any toxicological testing. Sodium laureth sulfate was demonstrated to be a dermal and ocular irritant but\nnot a sensitizer. The Expert Panel recognized that there are data gaps regarding use and concentration of these ingredients.\nHowever, the overall information available on the types of products in which these ingredients are used and at what\nconcentrations indicates a pattern of use. The potential to produce irritation exists with these salts of sulfated ethoxylated\nalcohols, but in practice they are not regularly seen to be irritating because of the formulations in which they are used. These\ningredients should be used only when they can be formulated to be nonirritating.\nKeywords\ncosmetics, safety, sodium laureth sulfate, salts of sulfated ethoxylated alcohols\nThe Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) Expert Panel previ-\nously evaluated the safety of sodium myreth sulfate, with the\nconclusion, based on data for sodium myreth sulfate and\nsodium laureth sulfate, that sodium myreth sulfate is safe as\na cosmetic ingredient in the present practices of use and\nconcentration.1, p157\nSodium myreth sulfate is the sodium salt of sulfated, ethoxylated\nmyristyl alcohol which is used as a surfactant and cleansing\nagent in cosmetics at concentrations ranging from >1.0 %-5.0%\nto >50.0 %. A formulation containing 7.0 %sodium myreth sul-\nfate was shown to be an ocular irritant in experimental animals\nand in some human test subjects. These irritant effects were sim-\nilar to those previously reported for the chemically similar com-\npound sodium laureth sulfate, which was shown to be safe for use\nin cosmetics. The report summarizes the safety test data on\nsodium laureth sulfate. Based upon the combined data cited in\nthe report on both cosmetic ingredients, it is concluded that\nsodium myreth sulfate is safe as a cosmetic ingredient in the pres-\nent practices of use and concentration.\nThe reference to data for sodium laureth sulfate acknowledges\nan earlier safety assessment completed for ammonium laureth\nsulfate and sodium laureth sulfate, in which the Expert Panelacknowledged that although these ingredients can be eye and\nskin irritants, they can be used safely in the practices of use and\nconcentration reported.2,p1\nSodium laureth sulfate and ammonium laureth sulfate are used\nin cosmetic products as cleansing agents, emulsifiers, stabili-\nzers, and solubilizers. The ingredients have been shown to pro-\nduce eye and/or skin irritation in experimental animals and in\nsome human test subjects; irritation may occur in some users\nof cosmetic formulations containing the ingredients under con-\nsideration. The irritant effects are similar to those produced by\nother detergents, and the severity of the irritation appears to\nincrease directly with concentration. However, sodium and\nammonium laureth sulfate have not evoked adverse responses\nin any other toxicological testing.

It should be presumed that there\nis at least 1 use in a product category if a use concentration is\nreported in the industry survey. In other cases, the uses were\nreported but no concentration was provided. In that case, it may\nbe presumed that the use concentrations are similar to other use\nconcentrations of related ingredients in that product category.\nAs reported in the safety assessment of ammonium and\nsodium laureth sulfate, the laureth sulfate salts are used as\nshampoo, bath, and skin-cleansing ingredients, primarily\nbecause of both their high degree of foaming and detergency\nand their ‘‘softness’’ to the skin.2They also function as emul-\nsifiers, stabilizers, and perfume solubilizers and are compatible\nwith nonionics, amides, amphoterics, and other anionic sys-\ntems. Their surface-active characteristics allow the laureth sul-\nfates to be especially useful ingredients in products that require\nhard water tolerance and lime soap dispersing power. These\nlast characteristics increase with the degree of ethoxylation.\nNoncosmetic\nThe anionic surfactants included in this report are generally\nrecognized for their thickening effect and ability to create\nlather; therefore, they have applications in industrial products\nincluding engine degreasers, floor cleaners, and car wash\nsoaps.\nNew Safety Data\nOcular Irritation\nTests were performed on ammonium alcohol ethoxy sulfate\n(the length of alkyl chain and degree of ethoxylation was not\nspecified) in 10 %and 20%concentrations of a liquid formula-\ntion containing 9 %active material. This substance was found\nto be nonirritating when instilled into the eyes of 20 human\nvolunteers.7\nMucosal Irritation\nWhen applied once daily for 2 weeks to male and female geni-\ntalia, a 25 %solution of a product containing 9 %ammonium\nalcohol ethoxy sulfate was found to be nonirritating.7152S International Journal of Toxicology 29(Supplement 3)\n152Table 1.

another had considered sodium myreth sul-\nfate. This amended safety assessment combined and extended\nthe previous assessments to include all salts of sulfated ethoxy-\nlated alcohols. Sodium laureth sulfate was the most studied of\nthis group of cosmetic ingredients, all of which are salts of sul-\nfated, ethoxylated alcohols, used primarily as surfactant emulsi-\nfiers and cleansing agents in soaps and shampoos, over a wide\nrange of concentrations from 0.008 %to 50.0%.\nData on additional ingredients were limited and did not raise\nany safety concerns.Discussion\nThe CIR Expert Panel recognized that most of the acute oral\ntoxicity, dermal irritation and sensitization, subchronic and\nchronic oral toxicity, reproductive and developmental toxicity,\ncarcinogenicity, and photosensitization studies have been con-\nducted on ammonium laureth sulfate and sodium laureth sul-\nfate. There are limited safety test data on most of the other\ningredients included in this safety assessment. Sodium and\nammonium laureth sulfate have not evoked adverse responses\nin any toxicological testing, including acute oral toxicity, sub-\nchronic and chronic oral toxicity, reproductive and develop-\nmental toxicity, carcinogenicity, and photosensitization\nstudies. These data, however, are considered a sufficient basisTable 2 (continued)\nProduct Category 2007 Uses52008 Use Concentrations6\nEye makeup preparations\nEye makeup remover (114) 11 0.01%-0.02%\nNoncoloring hair preparations\nShampoos (1022) 19 0.5%\nOther noncoloring hair preparations (464) 1\nPersonal cleanliness products\nBath soaps and detergents (594) 3 0.4%-2%\nOther personal cleanliness products (390) 1 0.4%e\nSkin care preparations\nCleansing (1009) 8 0.2%\nOther skin care preparations (915) 1 —\nTotal uses/ranges for sodium oleth sulfate 47 0.01%-2%\nSodium trideceth sulfate\nBaby products\nShampoos (38) 25 3%\nBaby lotions, oils, powders, and creams 67) — 3%\nOther baby products (64) 20 2%-3%\nBath preparations\nOther bath preparations (276) 1 —\nEye makeup\nEye makeup removers (114) 7 —\nNoncoloring hair preparations\nShampoos (1022) 13 2%-17%\nHair coloring products\nColoring shampoos (27) 1 —\nPersonal hygiene products\nBath soaps and detergents (594) 29 2%-10%\nOther personal cleanliness products (390) 1 3%-19%\nFeminine hygiene deodorants (7) — 3%\nSkin care preparations\nCleansing (1009) 35 0.6%-18%\nTotal uses/ranges for sodium trideceth sulfate 132 0.6%-19%\naDash indicates not reported.

Based on\nthese considerations, safety test data on 1 ingredient may be\nextrapolated to all of them.\nThe CIR Expert Panel also recognized that there are data\ngaps regarding use and concentration of these ingredients.\nHowever, the overall information available on the types of\nproducts in which these ingredients are used and at what con-\ncentrations indicates a pattern of use that was considered by the\nExpert Panel in assessing safety. (Were ingredients in this\ngroup not in current use to be used in the future, the expectation\nis that they would be used in product categories and at concen-\ntrations comparable with others in the group.)\nThe panel noted that sodium laureth sulfate and ammonium\nlaureth sulfate can produce eye and/or skin irritation in experi-\nmental animals and in some human test subjects; irritation may\noccur in some users of cosmetic formulations containing these\ningredients. The irritant effects, however, are similar to those\nproduced by other detergents, and the severity of the irritation\nappears to increase directly with concentration.\nConclusion\nThe CIR Expert Panel concludes that sodium myreth sulfate,\nammonium capryleth sulfate, ammonium myreth sulfate, ammo-\nnium laureth sulfate, ammonium C12-15 pareth sulfate, magne-\nsium coceth sulfate, magnesium laureth sulfate, magnesium\nmyreth sulfate, magnesium oleth sulfate, sodium coceth sulfate,\nsodium C10-15 pareth sulfate, sodium C12-13 pareth sulfate,\nsodium C12-15 pareth sulfate, sodium laneth sulfate, sodium\nlaureth sulfate, sodium oleth sulfate, sodium deceth sulfate,sodium trideceth sulfate, and zinc coceth sulfate are safe as cos-\nmetic ingredients in the present practices of use and concentra-\ntion when formulated to be nonirritating.1\nAuthors’ Note\nUnpublished sources cited in this report are available from the Direc-\ntor, Cosmetic Ingredient Review, 1101 17th Street, Suite 412,\nWashington, DC 20036, USA.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nNo potential conflict of interest relevant to this article was reported.

The very ﬁrst safety assessments were pub-lished in earlier incarnations of this journal—the Journal of En-\nvironmental Pathology and Toxicology in 1980, and the Journal\nof the American College of Toxicology from 1982 to 1996.\nBecause information relevant to the safety of ingredients may\nhave become available since these early safety assessments werepublished, the CIR Expert Panel has initiated a re-review pro-cess. If new information is thought to be available or if a longperiod of time has passed, the CIR Expert Panel may initiate asearch for relevant new data.\nIn some cases, newly available data are largely redundant\nwith the data available in the original safety assessment. In othercases, there are new safety data. If after considering the newlyavailable information, the CIR Expert Panel decides not to re-open a safety assessment, this ﬁnding, along with any back-ground material, is summarized and announced publicly. Toassure that the scientiﬁc community is aware of any new in-formation and the decision not to reopen, this Annual Review\nof Cosmetic Ingredient Safety Assessments is prepared. This an-\nnual review covers all ingredients re-reviewed from February,2002, to June, 2003.\nFor each original safety assessment the re-review addresses\nthe import of new studies that were considered by the Panel,\nif any were available. A reference list is provided that updatesthe references provided in the original safety assessment. There-review also captures information on the industry’s currentpractices of ingredient use, updating the data available in theearlier report. Although this material provides the opinion ofthe CIR Expert Panel regarding the new data described, it doesnot constitute a full safety review.\nThe ingredients the CIR Expert Panel reconsidered in 2002/\n2003, and decided not to reopen are:\nAcetylated Lanolin\nAcetylated Lanolin AlcoholAlmond MealAmmonium Laureth Sulfate\nAddress correspondence to Director, Cosmetic Ingredient Review,\n1101 17th Street, NW, Suite 310, Washington, DC 20036, USA.\n1Reviewed by the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel.Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate\nBeeswaxBenzophenone-1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -8, -9, and -11n-ButaneButoxyethanolButyl StearateCeresinCetearyl Ethylhexanoate (formerly Cetearyl Octanoate)Cetyl PalmitateCetyl StearateCholeth-24Copernica Cerifera (Carnauba) WaxDibutyl PhthalateDiethyl PhthalateDiisopropyl AdipateDimethicone PEG-6 AcetateDimethicone PEG-8 AdipateDimethicone PEG-8 BenzoateDimethicone PEG-7 PhosphateDimethicone PEG-10 PhosphateDimethicone PEG/PPG-7/4 PhosphateDimethicone PEG/PPG-12/4 PhosphateDimethicone PEG/PPG-20/23 BenzoateDimethicone CopolyolDimethyl PhthalateDiethylhexyl Adipate (formerly Dioctyl Adipate)Emulsifying Wax N.F.Ethylhexyl Palmitate (formerly Octyl Palmitate)Ethylhexyl Stearate (formerly Octyl Stearate)Euphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) WaxHydrogenated LanolinHydroxylated LanolinIsobutaneIsobutyl StearateIsocetyl StearateIsopentaneIsopropyl MyristateIsopropyl PalmitateIsopropyl StearateIsostearic AcidLaneth-5, -16, and -25Laneth-9 and -10 AcetateLanolinLanolin Oil\n12 COSMETIC INGREDIENT REVIEW\nLanolin Acid\nLanolin AlcoholLanolin WaxLaureth-4 and -23Microcrystalline WaxMontan WaxMyrtistyl MyristateMyristyl StearateOctyl PalmitateOctyl StearateOzokeriteParafﬁnPEG-3, -7, -8, -9, -10, -12, -14, and -17 DimethiconePEG-2, -6, -8, -12, -20, -32, -40, -50, -100, and -150 StearatePEG/PPG-3/10, -4/12, -6/11, -8/14, -14/4, -15/15, -16/2, -17/18,\n-18/18, -19/19, -20/6, -20/15, -20/23, -20/29, -22/23, -22/24,-23/6, -25/25, and -27/27 Dimethicone\nPolyamino Sugar CondensatePolybutenePolyquaternium-11Potassium Cocyl Hydrolyzed Collagen (formerly Potassium-\nCoco-Hydrolyzed Animal Protein)\nPropanePropylene Glycol Stearate and Propylene Glycol Stearate SEPrunus Amygdalus Dulcis Oil (formerly Sweet Almond Oil)Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis Seed Meal (formerly Almond Meal)Rhus Succedanea Fruit WaxSodium Laureth SulfateSodium Lauryl SulfateSweet Almond Oil\nSynthetic BeeswaxSynthetic WaxTEA-Cocoyl Hydrolyzed Collagen (formerly TEA-Coco-Hydro-\nlyzed Animal Protein)\nV A/Crotonates Copolymer (formerly V A/CA Copolymer)\nACETYLATED LANOLIN, ACETYLATED LANOLINALCOHOL, HYDROGENATED LANOLIN,HYDROXYLATED LANOLIN, LANOLIN (ANHYDROUS),LANOLIN ACID, LANOLIN ALCOHOL, LANOLIN OIL,\nAND LANOLIN WAX\nA safety assessment of Acetylated Lanolin, Acetylated\nLanolin Alcohol, Hydrogenated Lanolin, Hydroxylated Lanolin,Lanolin (anhydrous), Lanolin Acid, Lanolin Alcohol, LanolinOil, and Lanolin Wax was published in 1980 in which the CIRExpert Panel concluded that these ingredients are safe for topicalapplication to humans in the then present practice of use and con-centration (Elder 1980). The Panel reviewed new studies (listedat the end of this section), along with updated information re-garding types and concentrations of use. The Panel determinedto not reopen this safety assessment.CIR Expert Panel acknowledged that there are current uses\nof lanolin compounds that may include aerosols. The effects ofinhaled aerosols depend on the speciﬁc chemical species, theconcentration, the duration of exposure, and site of depositionwithin the respiratory system. Particle size is the most importantfactor affecting the location of deposition (Jensen and O’Brien1993). The mean aerodynamic diameter of pump hair spray par-ticles is ≥80μand the diameter of anhydrous spray particles\nis 60 to 80 μ. Typically, less than 1% are below 10 μ, which is\nthe upper limit for respirable particles (Bower 1999). Based onthe particle size, lanolin and related compounds would not berespirable in formulation.\nThe panel also noted that animal derived products may con-\ntain residues present in the plant material ingested by the an-imal. Manufacturers are reminded that cosmetic products con-taining plant or animal derived ingredients should be formulatedto limit the presence of pesticide/heavy metal residues as fol-\nlows: lead ≤10 ppm, arsenic ≤3 ppm, mercury ≤1 ppm, total\nPCB/pesticide contamination ≤40 ppm with ≤10 ppm for any\nspeciﬁc residue (Andersen 1998). In addition, the CIR ExpertPanel has recently stressed that animal-derived ingredients must\nbe free of detectible pathogens and/or infectious agents (e.g.,\nprions). Suppliers and users of these ingredients should assurethat these ingredients are risk-free. Tests to assure the absenceof a pathogenic agent in the ingredients, or controls to assuredeviation from pathogen-free sources are two approaches thatshould be considered.\nData from the 1980 report on frequency of use and concen-\ntration of use (circa 1976) is provided in Table 1 along withcurrent frequency and concentration of use and total products\nin each category as provided by the Food and Drug Administra-\ntion (FDA) and Cosmetic, Toiletry, and Fragrance Association(CTFA) (FDA 2002; CTFA 2003). Although the total numberof products containing lanolin and related compounds has de-creased since 1980 (5196 in 1980 versus 2438 in 2002), there hasbeen an increase in the variety of product categories containingthese chemicals. In the 1980 report, the highest concentrationsof these ingredients were in makeup and eye makeup prepara-tions, skin care, suntan and sunscreen preparations, manicur-\ning products, noncoloring hair preparations, and hair-coloring\npreparations. In 2003, lipsticks and rouges have the highest useconcentrations.\nAcetylated Lanolin. Acetylated lanolin is the acetylated es-\nter of lanolin (q.v.) and is used as hair conditioning agent and skinconditioning agent, both emollient and occlusive. It was used in127 cosmetic products in 1976, with the highest concentrationrange of >0.1% to 50% in eye and other make-up preparations.\nCurrently Acetylated lanolin is used in 151 products at a maxi-\nmum use concentration of 7% in makeup foundations. Table 1provides the available use information.\nAcetylated Lanolin Alcohol is the acetyl ester of Lanolin Al-\ncohol (q.v.) and is primarily used as a hair conditioning agent andskin-conditioning agent—emollient and occlusive. It was usedin 376 cosmetic products in 1976, with the highest concentrationSAFETY ASSESSMENTS: 2002/2003 3\nTABLE 1\nHistorical and current cosmetic product uses and concentrations for Acetylated

Studies available sincethat safety assessment was completed, along with the updated\ninformation regarding uses and use concentrations, were con-\nsidered by the CIR Expert Panel. The Panel determined to notreopen this safety assessment.SAFETY ASSESSMENTS: 2002/2003 19\nTABLE 3\nHistorical and current cosmetic product uses and concentrations for Butoxyethanol\n1984 use 2001 use 1984 concentrations 2001 concentrations\nProduct category (Andersen 1996) (FDA 2001) (Andersen 1996) (%) (CTFA 2001) (%)\nEye shadow — — — 3Shampoos (noncoloring) 2 — ≤0.1–1\nHair tonics, dressings, etc. — 2 — —Wave sets 1 — 1–5Hair dyes and colors 90 94 1–10 —Hair tints — 3 — —\nShampoos (coloring) — 8 — —Hair bleaches 4 2 1–10 —Blushers — — — 3Nail polish and enamel — 1 — 3\nNail polish and enamel removers 1 — 5–10 50\nTotal uses/ranges for Butoxyethanol 121 110 ≤0.1–10 3–50\nThe Panel noted that the in vitro hematotoxicity study by\nRuchaud et al. (1992), cited in the published Final Report, hasbeen retracted and agreed that the deletion of this referencewould have no substantive effect on this safety assessment.\nThe CIR Expert Panel discussion focused on the question-\nable evidence of carcinogenicity (in rats and mice) in a 2-yearinhalation carcinogenicity study on Butoxyethanol that was pub-lished by the NTP in 2000. The conclusions for rats and micewere as follows: no evidence of carcinogenic activity in malerats; equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity in female rats,based on increased combined incidences of benign or malignantpheochromocytoma (mainly benign) of the adrenal medulla;some evidence of carcinogenic activity in male mice, based onincreased incidences of hemangiosarcoma of the liver; marginalincrease in incidences of forestomach squamous cell papillomaand increase in incidences of hepatocellular carcinoma may havebeen exposure related; and some evidence of carcinogenic activ-ity in female mice, based on increased incidences of forestomachsquamous cell papilloma or carcinoma (mainly papilloma).\nAfter reviewing the NTP study, the Panel noted that the results\nare not relevant to man for the following reasons: (1) Pheochro-mocytomas observed in one rodent species were within the his-torical control range. (2) Liver cancer observed in a male ratwas thought to have been due to hemolysis [it has been shownthat rodent red blood cells are very sensitive to hemolysis byButoxyethanol, and that this effect was due to iron overload].(3) An increased incidence of forestomach cancers was observedin female mice after inhalation exposure. The forestomach is nota relevant organ for evaluation, and this effect was thought tohave been due to irritation, but not genotoxicity.\nThe Panel also considered current data indicating that Bu-\ntoxyethanol is used at concentrations up to 50% in nail polishand enamel removers, in light of its previous limitation of 10.0%\nin hair and nail products. However, it was concluded that the in-creased use concentration was of little concern because the nailplate is made up of dead tissue, and, thus, the amount of absorp-\ntion through the nail would be negligible.\nButoxyethanol was used in 121 cosmetic products in 1984,\nand a maximum use concentration of 10% was reported in 1984.Currently, there are 110 reported uses, with nail polish andenamel removers comprising the product category with the high-est ingredient use concentration (50% Butoxyethanol).

Studies available since that safetyassessment was completed, along with the updated informationregarding uses and use concentrations, were considered by theCIR Expert Panel. The Panel determined to not reopen this safetyassessment.\nOctyl Stearate is now called Ethylhexyl Stearate.\nThe Panel noted that the reproductive toxicity of 2-ethyl-1-\nhexanol, a hydrolysis product of Ethylhexyl Stearate, was ad-dressed in a fetotoxicity study on the cosmetic ingredient Di-ethylhexyl Adipate (Eastman Kodak Company 1992). It was\nTABLE 4\nHistorical and current product uses and concentrations for Stearates\n1981 concentrations 2003 concentrations\n1981 use 2002 use (Elder 1985) (CTFA 2003)\nProduct category (Elder 1985) (FDA 2002) (%) (%)\nButyl Stearate\nBubble baths — — — 43\nEyeliner 4 22 >1–5 0.4–9\nEye shadow 3 1 >0.1–5 0.5\nEye makeup remover — — — 0.2Mascara — — — 0.4Eye makeup (other) 4 — >5–25 —\nPerfumes — 1 — —Hair sprays (aerosol ﬁxatives) — — — —Hair conditioners 3 — >1–10 0.01\nShampoos (noncoloring) — — — 0.03\nHair tonics, dressings, etc. — — — 1\nFoundations 1 1 >10–25 0.04\nLipsticks 78 34 >1–25 0.02–0.3\nMakeup bases — 2 — —Rouges — — — 0.002Makeup (other) — — — 0.002Nail polish and enamel removers 2 — >0.1–5 —\nBath soaps and detergents — 2 — —Underarm deodorants 1 1 >1–5 2\nFeminine deodorants 1 — >0.1–1 —\nPersonal cleanliness products (other) — 3 — —Aftershave lotion — — — 0.1Preshave lotions 3 — >1–10 —\nShaving cream — — — 1Cleansing 1 — >1–5 1\nDepilatories — — — 1\n(Continued on next page)suggested that the fetotoxicity reported for mice in this study\nwas actually due to a zinc deﬁciency. Furthermore, given theextent of 2-ethyl-1-hexanol absorption and the load that wouldbe expected to enter the hepatic circulation, the potential for 2-ethyl-1-hexanol–induced reproductive toxicity was not thoughtto be an issue.\nButyl Stearate was used in 116 products in 1981, with the\nsingle largest use in lipstick in the concentration range of >1%\nto 25%. In 2002, Butyl Stearate was reportedly used in 78 prepa-rations, with the single largest use in lipstick; use concentrationdata provided in 2003 indicated use concentrations in this prod-uct category ranging from 0.02% to 0.3%.

The Panel determined tonot reopen this safety assessment.\nThe terminology for this ingredient in the International Cos-\nmetic Ingredient Dictionary and Handbook has changed. Ceter-\naryl Ethylhexanoate is the current terminology.\nSigniﬁcant among the new data were data on 2-ethylhexanoic\nacid (2-EHA) which has been shown to be a liver and develop-mental toxicant in animal studies at high dose levels. 2-EHA isa possible metabolite of Cetearyl Ethylhexanoate.\nIn developmental toxicity studies, it has been postulated that\n2-EHA maternal liver toxicity begins a cascade of effects thatincludes metallothionein (MT) induction, zinc accumulation inthe liver due to MT binding, and a resulting zinc deﬁciencyin the developing embryo. In this model, it is the zinc deﬁ-ciency in the developing embryo that causes developmentaltoxicity. Support for this mechanism of action comes from sev-eral sources. Animal studies have demonstrated that dietaryzinc supplementation reduces this toxic effect and that further\nzinc deﬁciency makes 2-EHA more toxic. In vitro studies us-\ning embryo cultures have demonstrated that either zinc deﬁ-cient or 2-EHA treated sera produced developmental toxicity.Zinc supplementation of either/both sera eliminated theeffect.\nTo further examine this question, Di-2-ethylhexyl terephtha-\nlate (DEHT), a 2-EHA precursor, was chosen as a model thatwould result in 2-EHA exposures without liver toxicity, MTinduction, etc. DEHT is metabolized in the gut and liver to 2-\nethylhexanol (2-EH) and terephthalate. Two moles of 2-EH areproduced per mole of DEHT. Subsequent hydrolysis of 2-EH\nproduces 2-EHA. It can be hypothesized that this pathway to2-EHA production from a precursor would not give rise to acuteliver toxicity, MT induction, zinc sequestration, and develop-mental toxicity.\nIn a reproductive and developmental toxicity study, 0%, 0.3%,\n0.6%, and 1% DEHT was provided in the feed of rats. The doseswere calculated to be 614 to 823 mg/kg day\n−1for males and 783\nto 1021 mg/kg day−1for females. Neither reproductive toxicity\nor developmental toxicity were seen at any dose level. Theseﬁndings suggest that the process of metabolic conversion ofDEHT to 2-EH, and subsequent hydrolysis to 2-EHA results ina time course of 2-EHA appearance that allows clearance beforesufﬁcient levels can arise to produce acute liver toxicity.\nWhile this study was undertaken to understand 2-EHA devel-\nopmental toxicity, the Panel considered that it is relevant to theassessment of Cetearyl Ethylhexanoate. Like DEHT, Cetearyl\nEthylhexanoate must undergo conversion in order to produce26 COSMETIC INGREDIENT REVIEW\n2-EHA. In addition, Cetearyl Ethylhexanoate, as used in cos-\nmetics, would have to pass through the stratum corneum and theepidermis before entering the blood stream, further moderatingthe time course of 2-EHA appearing in the liver. The Panel rec-ognized that Cetearyl Ethylhexanoate is used in lipsticks and thatingestion is possible from that use. It was the view of the CIRExpert Panel that these considerations would preclude any pos-sibility that Cetearyl Ethylhexanoate in cosmetics could presenta risk of developmental toxicity.\nTABLE 5\nCetearyl ethylhexanoate use\nProduct category No. of formulations Current no. of Concentration Current\n(no. of formulations with Cetearyl formulations with Cetearyl of use in 1976 concentration of use\nin the category) Ethylhexanoate in 1976 Ethylhexanoate (Elder 1982) (CTFA 2002a)\n(FDA 2002) (Elder 1982) (FDA 2002) (%) (%)\nBaby lotions, oils, powders, and\ncreams (60)—1 — —\nBath oils, tablets, and salts (143) 1 — Unknown —\nBath capsules (2) — — — 9Other bath preparations (196) 2 — 1–10 —Eyeliners (548) 1 — 0.1–1 —Eye shadows (576) 22 4 0–25 26–28Mascara (195) 6 — 0.1–1 0.07Other eye makeup preparations\n(152)2 3 0.1–5 3–5\nPowders (273) — 2 — —\nOther fragrance preparation (173) — 12 — —Hair conditioners (651) 5 — 0–5 —Hair sprays (aerosol ﬁxatives) (275) 5 5 0–5 —Hair straighteners (63) 1 — 0.1–1 —Rinses (noncoloring) (42) 1 — 0.1–1 —\nShampoos (noncoloring) (884) — — — 0.2Tonics, dressings, and other\nhair-grooming products (598)1 32 0.1–1 0.1\nWave sets (53) 1 — 1–5 —\nOther hair preps.

Stud-\nies available since that safety assessment was completed,along with the updated information regarding uses and useSAFETY ASSESSMENTS: 2002/2003 29\nconcentrations, were considered by the CIR Expert Panel. The\nPanel determined to not reopen this safety assessment.\nThe Panel noted that Octyl Palmitate is now termed Ethyl-\nhexyl Palmitate (Wenninger et al. 2000).\nIn 1976, collectively, Cetyl Palmitate, Ethylhexyl Palmitate,\nand Isopropyl Palmitate were used in 1335 cosmetic products,\nTABLE 6\nHistorical and current cosmetic product uses and concentrations for Cetyl, Ethylhexyl, and Isopropyl Palmitate\n1976 use 2001 use 1976 concentrations 2001 concentrations\nProduct category (Elder 1982) (FDA 2001) (Elder 1982) (%) (CTFA 2001) (%)\nCetyl Palmitate\nEyebrow pencil — 9 — —Eyeliner — 24 — 5–8Eye shadow 7 2 >1–5 11\nEye lotion — 2 — —Mascara — 1 — 0.2\nEye makeup (other) — 16 — —\nSachets 6 2 >1–5 —\nFragrance preparations (other) — 1 — —Shampoos (noncoloring) — 12 — 1Hair tonics, dressings, etc. 1 — >1–5 —\nHair-coloring preparations (other) — — — 0.2Blushers 24 — >0.1–5 —\nFoundations 12 4 >1–5 3\nLipsticks 290 10 >1–10 10\nMakeup bases 15 — >1–5 —\nMakeup (other) 4 5 >1–5 3\nUnderarm deodorants 1 — >1–5 0.3\nPersonal cleanliness products (other) 2 — >1–5 0.02\nAftershave lotion — 3 — 1Shaving preparations (other) — 2 — —Skin-cleansing creams, lotions, liquids, and pads 3 10 >1–5 <0.1–1\nFace and neck skin care preparations 18 31\n∗>1–5∗\nBody and hand skin care preparations 40 0.01–6\nMoisturizers 5 33 >0.1–5 2–3\nNight skin care preparations 1 12 >1–5 3\nPaste masks (mud packs) — 4 — —Skin fresheners — 1 — —Skin care preparations (other) 1 15 >1–5 5\nSuntan gels, creams, and liquids — 5 — 2Suntan preparations (other) — 5 — 2\nTotal uses/ranges for Cetyl Palmitate 373 236 >0.1–10 0.01–11\nEthylhexyl Palmitate\nBath oils, tablets, and salts 7 — >1–10 10–23\nBath preparations (other) — — — 6\nEyeliner — 2 — 2–42Eye shadow 24 129 >1–50 0.2–19\nEye makeup remover 1 2 >50 3\nEye makeup (other) 2 8 >25–>50 2–24\nColognes and toilet waters — 2 — —Perfumes 3 — >1–>50 —\n(Continued on next page)with the largest single use in lipsticks in the concentration range\nof>1% to 10% (Elder 1982a).

Since then many additionalstudies have appeared in the scientiﬁc literature. These studies,\nalong with the updated information in Table 8 regarding uses anduse concentrations, were considered by the CIR Expert Panel.Based on its consideration of the data discussed below, the Paneldecided not to reopen this safety assessment.\nDBP, DEP, and DMP are phthalate diesters that are used in\ncosmetics as plasticizers, solvents and fragrance ingredients in\na wide variety of cosmetic product types. DEP is also used asa denaturant. DBP is found primarily in nail care products (atconcentrations up to 15%) and in some hair care formulations(up to 0.1%). DEP is found in certain bath preparations, fra-grance products, deodorants, lotions, and other skin care prod-ucts. The highest reported concentration of use of DEP is 11%in perfumes. DMP is an ingredient in some hair care products,including aerosol ﬁxatives. The reported maximum concentra-\ntion of use of DMP in cosmetics is 2% in aerosol hair sprays.Table 8 provides the frequency and concentration of use as a\nfunction of product type.\nRecent studies document that DBP, DEP, and DMP all ab-\nsorb readily through the skin and through the gastrointestinal(GI) tract. Once absorbed, most short-chain phthalate diestersare hydrolyzed to the corresponding monoester and alcohol. Thephthalates and their metabolites distribute to most tissues, andcross the placenta, but they do not accumulate in any speciﬁc tis-sue type. Phthalates are quickly eliminated in the urine, usuallyas the corresponding monoester or its glucuronide conjugate.However, humans and primates metabolize longer-chain diesterphthalates (e.g., DEHP) into the glucuronide-conjugated mo-noester forms to a much larger extent than do rats. Also, ratsexcrete three to four times more free unconjugated MBP thando hamsters given similar doses of DBP or MBP, possibly due togreater testicular β-glucuronidase activity in rats than in ham-\nsters. Phthalates undergo some enterohepatic cycling, and somephthalate is eliminated in the feces.\nNew data on acute and short-term toxicity were consistent\nwith previously available data.\nIn a NTP study, DBP, DEP, and DMP were not found to be\ndermal irritants or sensitizers, conﬁrming previous data usinghuman and animal subjects.\nAlthough previous data had identiﬁed that orally adminis-\ntered (in feed or by gavage) DBP and its metabolite MBP have re-productive and developmental effects in rodents, with impaired\nmale development being the most sensitive effect, newly avail-able data provided additional demonstration of such effects.\nWhen pregnant rats and mice were exposed to 1.0% DBP\nin powdered feed throughout gestation, the pregnancy outcomeshowed reductions in fertility, number of pups per litter, numberof live pups, and body weights of pups. Adult male rats exposedto 1.0% DBP showed signs of liver and kidney toxicity andreduced weights of the prostate, testes, and seminal vesicles.Pregnant rats exposed to 2% DBP in feed throughout pregnancy\nhad a higher incidence of preimplantation loss and resorptions,\nand no male pups were born alive. Exposure to 1% or 2% DBPin feed only during the latter half of gestation did not show thepreimplantation loss and resorption rate seen in rats exposedthroughout pregnancy. However, the increased survivability ofthese fetuses allowed the morphological defects of developingfetuses to be observed. These defects included reduced body\nweights in both sexes at 2% DBP, reduced anogenital distance\nand undescended testes in male fetuses at 1% and 2% DBP, andincreased incidence of cleft palate and fused sternebrae. Adversefetal effects were not seen in this study in a 0.5% DBP feed group,or at 331 mg/kg/day, based on average food consumption.\nOral intubation (gavage) of DBP in rats during gestation pro-\nduced similar effects to those seen in the feeding studies de-scribed above. Pregnant rats given oral doses of approximately0.63 to 0.75 g/kg/day and higher on certain gestation days pro-\nduced litters with higher incidences of fetal toxicity and mal-\nformations. Exposure to DBP on gestation days 7 through 9 oron days 13 through 15 results in increased incidence of skeletalmalformations such as cleft palate, fused sternebrae, and ver-tebral anomalies, as well as dilatation of the renal pelvis andundescended testes. However, exposure to DBP on gestationdays 10 through 12 did not produce these effects, suggestingthat DBP teratogenicity may be age dependent. Prenatal expo-sure to MBP appears to produce fetotoxicity and teratogenicitysimilar to DBP, following the same patterns of age-dependent\nsensitivity and dose efﬁcacy. This supports the proposal that it\nis the monoester metabolite that produces the developmentaltoxicity of DBP and other phthalates.\nDEP fed to mice at concentrations up to 2.5% (calculated to\nbe 3.64 g/kg/day) in a continuous breeding protocol producedno effects of DEP on fertility or pregnancy outcome in the F\n0\ngeneration. F 1male mice of the 2.5% DEP group had enlarged\nprostates and reduced sperm counts, but sperm motility andmorphology were not affected. The F\n2generation showed no\ntreatment-related differences between DEP and control groups.Pregnant rats fed up to 5.0% DEP mixed in feed on gestationdays 6 through 15 produced no treatment-related alterations infetal viability or development.\nRepeated dermal application of 2 ml/kg up to 50% DEP to\npregnant rabbits on gestation days 6 through 18 did not producematernal or fetal toxicity or affect fetal development.\nDMP was not fetotoxic or teratogenic when administered\ndermally (in rats) or orally (in rats and mice) during gestation.SAFETY ASSESSMENTS: 2002/2003 35\nTABLE 8\nHistorical and current cosmetic product uses and concentrations for Dibutyl, Diethyl, and Dimethyl Phthalate\nProduct category1981 use\n(Elder 1985)2001 use\n(FDA 2001)1981 concentrations\n(FDA 1981)\n(%)2001 concentrations\n(CTFA 2001a, 2001b,\n2001c) (%)\nDibutyl Phthalate\nPerfumes — — — 38–890 ppm∗∗\nHair sprays — — — 55–160 ppm∗∗\nShampoos (noncoloring) — — — 0.007\nHair preparations (other noncoloring) 3 — >0.1–1 —\nHair-coloring preparations (other) 3 — >0.1–1 0.1\nAftershave lotions 3 — >0.1–1 —\nHair bleaches — — — 0.1Makeup (other) 1 — >0.1–1 0.5\nNail basecoats and undercoats 36 32 >1–10 1–6; 15\n∗\nNail creams and lotions — 2 — 5\nNail extenders — — — 1; 1∗\nNail polish and enamel 522 88 ≤25 0.5–15; 15∗\nNail polish and enamel removers 3 — 0.1–25 2\nNail care preparations (other) 14 25 ≤25 5–7; 6∗\nUnderarm deodorants — — — 140–200 ppm∗∗\nPersonal cleanliness products (other) 5 3 >1–5 —\nTotal uses/ranges for Dibutyl Phthalate 590 150 0.1–25 0.0038–15\nDiethyl Phthalate\nBaby shampoos — — — 0.03\nBaby lotions, oils, powders, and creams — — — 0.00003Baby products (other) — — — 0.05Bath oils, tablets, and salts 3 1 ≤5—\nBubble baths — — — 0.06Bath preparations (other) 2 2 ≤0.1 0.008–0.09\nColognes and toilet waters 19 24 ≤5 0.2–2\nPerfumes 23 7 ≤50 1–11\nPowders 1 5 >0.1–1 —\nSachets 3 2 >0.01–5 —\nOther fragrance preparations 2 11 >0.1–50 0.01–1\n67–28,000 ppm\n∗∗\nHair conditioners — — — 0.1–0.2Hair sprays (aerosol ﬁxatives) 5 — >0.1–5 0.4\n17–1500 ppm\n∗∗\nShampoos (noncoloring) — — — 0.0008–0.2\nHair tonics, dressings, etc. — 1 — 14–220 ppm∗∗\nWave sets 1 — >0.1–1 —\nFace powders — — — 0.4Eye shadow 1 — ≤0.1 —\nEyebrow pencil — — — 0.007\nMascara — — — 0.007–0.07Eye makeup preparations (other) — — — 0.07\nFoundations — — — 0.3Makeup (other) — — — 0.0003Nail polish and enamel — — — 0.1Nail polish and enamel remover 1 — >1–5 —\n(Continued on next page)36 COSMETIC INGREDIENT REVIEW\nTABLE 8\nHistorical and current cosmetic product uses and concentrations for Dibutyl, Diethyl, and Dimethyl Phthalate (Continued)\nProduct category1981 use\n(Elder 1985)2001 use\n(FDA 2001)1981 concentrations\n(FDA 1981)\n(%)2001 concentrations\n(CTFA 2001a, 2001b,\n2001c) (%)\nNail care preparations (other) — — — 0.2Bath soaps and detergents 1 — >0.1–1 2\nUnderarm deodorants — 4 — 0.3–1\n20–3300 ppm\n∗∗\nFeminine hygiene deodorants — — — 0.4Other personal cleanliness products — — — 1Aftershave lotion 3 4 >0.1–1 0.5–2\nShaving cream (aerosol, brushless, and lather) — — — 0.001Other shaving preparation products — — — 1Skin-cleansing creams, lotions, liquids and pads — — — 0.0002Face and neck skin care preparations 1\n∗∗∗— ≤0.1∗∗∗0.3\nBody and hand skin care preparations 2 0.008–0.5\n26–190 ppm∗∗\nFoot powders and sprays — — — 1Night skin care preparations — — — 0.0004Paste masks (mud packs) — 1 — 0.1Skin fresheners — 4 — 0.1–0.9Skin care preparations (other) 1 5 >0.1–1 0.00003–0.9\nTotal uses/ranges for Diethyl Phthalate 67 73 ≤0.1–50 0.00003–2\nDimethyl Phthalate\nHair conditioners 2 — >0.1–1 —\nHair sprays (aerosol ﬁxatives) — 8 — 0.00002–2Hair rinses 1 — >0.1–1 —\nShampoos (noncoloring) — — — 0.00002Hair tonics, dressings, etc. 2 — >0.1–5 —\nWave sets 2 — >0.1–1 —\nHair preparations (other noncoloring) 4 3 >0.1–1 —\nHair color sprays (aerosol) — 1 — —Blushers — — — 0.00008Face powders — — — 0.00008Foundations — — — 0.005Bath soaps and detergents — — — 0.004Underarm deodorants — — — 33 ppm\n∗∗–0.2\nAftershave lotions — — — 0.2\nTotal use/ranges for Dimethyl Phthalate 11 12 >0.1–5 .00002–2\n∗Maximum concentrations reported by Nail Manufacturers Council (NMC 2001).\n∗∗Concentrations found in off-the-shelf products (Houlihan et al. 2002).\n∗∗∗These categories were combined when the original safety assessment was performed and are now separate categories.\nExposure to some phthalates has been shown to cause impair-\nments of normal male development in rodents. The documented\nmale-speciﬁc effects of phthalates include malformations of theepididymis and vas deferens, undescended testes, hypospadias,\nretention of thoracic nipples, and reduced anogenital distance.DEP and DMP did not cause the dramatic effects on male devel-opment seen with longer-chain dialkyl phthalates. Many studieshave reviewed the mechanisms of the male-targeted toxicity of\nphthalates. DBP, DEP, and DMP have weak or no binding afﬁnityfor the estrogen receptor and do not affect estrogen-regulated de-velopmental endpoints. An antiandrogenic mechanism has beenproposed, but many studies show that these phthalates do notbind with androgen receptors, either. However, phthalate es-ters inhibit the synthesis of testosterone, which is an importantSAFETY ASSESSMENTS: 2002/2003 37\nhormone in normal development in males. DBP has also been\nshown to inhibit the action of M¨ ullerian Inhibiting Substance\nproduced by Sertoli cells.\nDBP, DEP, and DMP previously had been screened for mu-\ntagenicity in the Ames bacterial reverse mutation assay with nomutagenic potential found. Additional data were available re-porting that DBP caused an increase in the number of TA100 re-vertants in the absence but not in the presence of S9 rat liver frac-tion. DEP caused increases in the numbers of TA100 and TA1535revertants, but this effect was also eliminated by the presenceof S9. DMP caused an increase in the number of TA1535 rever-tants, but S9 prevented the effect. Overall, DBP, DEP, and DMPcontinue to have little genotoxic potential. One study on malesof subfertile couples examined the relationship between envi-ronmental exposures to phthalates and DNA damage in humansperm using the neutral comet assay which is said to measure atleast two aspects of DNA integrity. Neither the monobutyl formof DBP nor DMP had a signiﬁcant association with comet as-say parameters, and a signiﬁcant association with the monobutylform of DEP was seen only with one measure of DNA integrity.\nPhthalates are a matter of concern for those responsible for\npublic health and have been (and continue to be) reviewed by\nmany government and international organizations. Phthalatesare ubiquitous in the modern environment. The monoester\nmetabolites sof phthalates have been detected in the urine ofan adult reference population and in the urine of young childrenin a small pilot study.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2003) found\nthat the urinary concentrations of the monoester metabolites ofDBP and DEP in 2536 Americans were similar or slightly lowerthan those reported in a preliminary study of 289 adults (Blountet al. 2000). Environmental exposure to phthalates and otherendocrine disruptors have been proposed to be linked to an in-creased incidence of hypospadias in humans. The developmen-tal effects of phthalates seen in rodents raise questions about thepotential for human health risks. However, these effects seenin rodents are at much higher exposure levels than humans arelikely to encounter, and they are subject to the species differ-ences in the metabolism of phthalate diesters. The estimatedmedian exposure levels of DEP and DBP are 57 μg/kg/day and\n7μg/kg/day, respectively, while the U.S. EPA reference doses\n(RfD) for DEP and DBP are 800 μg/kg/day and 100 μg/kg/day,\nrespectively. Thus, the human exposure is well below the safetylimits set by the U.S. EPA. Even the median exposure levels ofthe highest-exposed group (women aged 20 to 40 years) are wellbelow the RfDs. Exposure levels were not available for DMP.\nScientiﬁc committees with the governments of the United\nStates and the European Union have evaluated the human risks\nof DBP and DEP and expressed minimal to no concern over\nconsumer exposure to these compounds (NTP Center for theEvaluation of Risks to Human Reproduction 2000; NetherlandsOrganization for Applied Scientiﬁc Research and National Insti-tute of Public Health and the Environment 2000; Scientiﬁc Com-mittee on Cosmetic Products and Non-Food Products 2002).As in the original safety assessment of these phthalate diesters\nin 1984, the primary safety issue regarding phthalate esters inthis re-review is antiandrogenic activity and the potential effectson male development. The CIR Expert Panel noted that the freemonoester metabolite appears to be the active agent in phthalatediester toxicity. Of the three compounds reviewed in this safetyassessment, Dibutyl Phthalate raised the most concern.\nThe Panel reviewed the numerous studies that describe the\ndevelopmental toxicity of DBP in rodents. The Panel noted thatthe no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) of DBP in a gav-age study was 50 mg/kg/day (Mylchreest et al. 2000). However,a feeding study reported a NOAEL of 331 mg/kg/day (Ema et al.1998). Overall, the Panel felt that feeding studies better representthe type of exposure that humans would receive from cosmeticsthan do gavage studies, but agreed that a worst-case NOAEL of50 mg/kg/day should be considered.\nThe Panel considered a Margin of Safety (MOS) approach\nto assess the risk of DBP exposure to human users of cosmeticsbased on calculated exposures and the animal developmentaltoxicity data. Exposure calculations were based on ingredient\nconcentration of use in cosmetic products (CTFA, 2001a, 2001b,\n2001c; Houlihan et al. 2002), extent of cosmetic use survey data(Environ Corporation 1985; CTFA 2002b), and dermal (Mintet al. 1994) and subungual penetration data (Jackson ResearchAssociation 2002). A conservative approach to penetration wasused; i.e., an estimate of approximately 5% absorption of DEPin human skin was considered to be a conservative estimate ofDBP absorption, because data suggest that DEP is more readilyabsorbed in rat skin than DBP (Scott et al. 1987). The Panel usedan estimated consumer body weight of 60 kg.\nThe expected exposure was calculated as follows:\nNail Basecoat or Polish\n•280 mg/application to 10 ﬁngernails (Environ Corpo-\nration 1985)\n•15% maximum DBP in nail basecoats and polish (CTFA\n2001a, 2001b, 2001c; Houlihan et al. 2002)\n•8.5% penetration through nail in 14 days (Jackson Re-search Association 2002)\n280 mg/day ×15%×8.5%/14 days =0.255 mg/day/60 kg =\n4.25μg/kg/day and 4.25 μg/kg/day ×2 (for ﬁngers and toes) =\n8.5μg/kg/day\n.\nHair Spray\n•5 g/day hair spray use (CTFA, 2002)\n•160μg/g DBP in hair spray (Houlihan et al. 2002)\n•20% skin contact, from CTFA maximum worst case\n•5% skin absorption (Mint et al. 1994)\n5 g/day ×160μg/g×20%×5%=8μg/day/60 kg =0.14\nμg/kg/day .38 COSMETIC INGREDIENT REVIEW\nDeodorant\n•0.52 g/day deodorant use (Environ Corporation 1984)\n•200μg/g DBP in deodorant (Houlihan et al. 2002)\n•5% skin absorption (Mint et al. 1994)\n0.52 g/day ×200μg/g×5%=5.2μg/day/60 kg =0.09\nμg/kg/day .\nPerfume\n•0.53 g/day perfume use (CTFA 2002)\n•890μg/g DBP in perfume (Houlihan et al. 2002)\n•5% skin absorption (Mint et al. 1994)\n0.53 g/day ×890μg/g×5%=24μg/day/60 kg =0.4μg/kg/day .\nTotal Exposure\n•Sum of each of the separate exposures\n8.5μg/kg/day +0.14μg/kg/day +0.09μg/kg/day +0.4\nμg/kg/day =9.13μg/kg/day\nThe calculated estimated exposure level of DBP from the con-\ncurrent use of multiple cosmetic products was 9.13 μg/kg/day.\nThis value is within the reported range of total human expo-sure to DBP from all sources in women, 32 μg/kg/day (upper\n95th percentile for women of reproductive age) to 6.5 μg/kg/day\n(upper 95th percentile for rest of group). Therefore, the Panelaccepted 9.13 μg/kg/day as a not unreasonable approximation\nof DBP exposure from cosmetic products.\nThe Panel calculated the MOS of DBP by dividing the\nNOAEL of 331 mg/kg/day (from a feeding study) by the ex-pected exposure of 9.13 μg/kg/day, yielding an MOS of 36,254.\nIf the more conservative NOAEL of 50 mg/kg/day (from a gav-age study) is used, the MOS is 5476. The Panel also noted thatboth NOAEL ﬁgures were obtained from rat studies, and detoxi-ﬁcation metabolism of DBP is faster in humans than in rats.\nThe Panel acknowledged the use of DBP, DEP, and DMP\nin hair sprays. The effects of inhaled aerosols depend on thespeciﬁc chemical species, the concentration, the duration of ex-posure, and site of deposition (Jensen and O’Brien 1993) withinthe respiratory system. Particle size is the most important fac-tor affecting the location of deposition. The mean aerodynamicdiameter of pump hair spray particles is approximately 80 μm,\nand the diameter of anhydrous hair spray particles is 60 to 80μm. Typically less than 1% are below 10 μm which is the up-\nper limit for respirable particles (Bowen 1999). Based on theparticle size, DBP, DEP, and DMP would not be respirable informulation. Therefore, exposure of the lung by inhalation was\nnot considered likely.\nBased on the available information included in this report, the\nCIR Expert Panel concluded that Dibutyl Phthalate, DimethylPhthalate, and Diethyl Phthalate are safe for use in cosmeticproducts in the present practices of use and concentrations.REFERENCES\nAgarwal, D.

New studies given atthe end of this section, along with updated information regard-ing products in which these ingredients are used and at whatconcentrations, were considered by the CIR Expert Panel. ThePanel determined to not reopen this safety assessment.\nIn cosmetic product labeling, Dioctyl Adipate is currently\ngiven as Diethylhexyl Adipate (Pepe 2002).\nDiethylhexyl Adipate was used in 27 product categories in\n1981, with maximum concentrations in the >10% to 25% range.SAFETY ASSESSMENTS: 2002/2003 45\nIn 2002 there were 49 reported uses of Diethylhexyl Adipate,\nwith a current maximum concentration of use of 38%. Diiso-propyl Adipate was used in 112 product categories in 1981,with a maximum concentration in the >10% to 25% range. In\n2002, there were 66 reported uses of Diisopropyl Adipate at acurrent maximum concentration of 15%.\nThe Panel noted that a new use in aerosols is reported. The ef-\nfects of inhaled aerosols depend on the speciﬁc chemical species,the concentration, the duration of exposure, and site of deposi-tion within the respiratory system. Particle size is the most im-portant factor affecting the location of deposition (Jensen andO’Brien 1993). The mean aerodynamic diameter of pump hairspray particle is ≥80μand the diameter of anhydrous spray\nparticles is 60 to 80 μ. Typically, less than 1% are below 10 μ,\nwhich is the upper limit for respirable particles (Bower 1999).Although there are no inhalation toxicity data speciﬁc to theseingredients, based on the particle size, lanolin and related com-pounds would not be respirable in formulation.\nTABLE 10\nHistorical and current frequencies and concentrations of use for Diethylhexyl and Diisopropyl Adipate\n1981 use 2003 use\n1981 use 2002 use concentration concentration\nProduct category (Elder, 1984) (FDA, 2002) (Elder, 1984) (%) (CTFA, 2003) (%)\nDiethylhexyl Adipate\nBath oils, tablets, salts 4 — >10–25 —\nEye lotion — — — 0.6Eye makeup (other) — 2 — 0.4–2Colognes and toilet waters 6 — >1–5\nBlushers 1 3 ≤0.1 13\nMakeup foundations 4 2 >0.1–10 16\nMakeup bases — 6 — 6Lipstick 5 1 >1–5 —\nMakeup (other) 1 2 >1–5 —\nFragrance preparations (other) — 5 — —Cuticle softeners — 1 — —Nail creams and lotions — 1 — —Nail polish and enamel remover 2 — >1–5 —\nUnderarm deodorants 1 — >0.1–1 8\nPersonal cleanliness products (other) — 4 — —Shaving cream — 5 — —Aftershave lotions 1 — >1–5 1\nFace and neck skin care preparations 2 —1\n∗>1–5∗\nBody and hand skin care preparations 2 —\nSkin care preparations (other) — 5 — —Moisturizers — 4 — —Suntan gels, creams, and liquids — 1 — 38Indoor tanning preparations — 2 — 12Suntan preparations (other) 1 1 >0.1–1 —\nTotal uses/ranges for Diethylhexyl Adipate 27 49 ≤0.1–25 0.4–38\n(Continued on next page)Although the maximum reported concentration of use for\nDiethylhexyl Adipate has increased to 38% (in suntan prepara-tions), the Panel stated that the available skin data support thesafety of this leave-on use concentration.\nThe Panel did express initial concern over a Diethylhexyl Adi-\npate fetotoxicity study in which the NOAEL was 200 mg/kg.An exposure assessment that assumed 40 g of use per day atconcentrations up to 40% for a 60-kg individual resulted in amaximum exposure of 250 mg/kg, which is higher than theNOAEL. Based on a calculated octanol/water partition coef-ﬁcient and the information that Diethylhexyl Adipate is not\nsoluble in water, however, the Panel concluded that this ingre-dient would not be substantially absorbed and the actual ex-\nposure would be at least two orders of magnitude below theNOAEL.\nTable 10 presents the current and historic frequencies and\nconcentrations of use for Diethylhexyl Adipate and DiisopropylAdipate.46 COSMETIC INGREDIENT REVIEW\nTABLE 10\nHistorical and current frequencies and concentrations of use for Diethylhexyl and Diisopropyl Adipate (Continued)\n1981 use 2003 use\n1981 use 2002 use concentration concentration\nProduct category (Elder, 1984) (FDA, 2002) (Elder 1984) (%) (CTFA 2003) (%)\nDiisopropyl Adipate\nBath oils, tablets, and salts 7 5 >1–25 5\nBubble baths 1 — >1–5 —\nBath preparations (other) — 1 — 8Eyeliner 1 — >1–5 —\nEye shadow 1 — >10–25 —\nColognes and toilet waters 15 16 >0.1–5 8\nPerfumes 20 14 >1–25 8\nSachets 1 — >10–25 —\nFragrance preparations (other) 9 2 >0.1–25 15\nHair conditioners 3 — ≤0.1–1 0.1\nHair sprays (aerosol ﬁxatives) 1 1 >1–5 3\nTonics, dressings, and other hair-grooming aids 4 2 >1–5 —\nWave sets 2 — — —Blushers (all types) 1 — >1–5 —\nFace powders 1 — >1–5 —\nMakeup foundations 1 — >0.1–1 5\nNail polish and enamel removers — 1 — 3Personal cleanliness products (other) 1 — >0.1–1 —\nUnderarm deodorants — — — 0.01Aftershave lotions 16 10 >0.1–5 1\nPreshave lotions (all types) 1 — >5–10 5\nSkin-cleansing creams, lotions, liquids, etc. 5 1 >0.1–1 —\nFace and neck creams, lotions, etc. —\n∗1—∗—\nBody and hand creams, lotions, etc. 1 2–3Foot powders and sprays 1 — >0.1–1 —\nMoisturizers 2 5 >0.1–5 0.2\nNight skin care preparations 1 — >5–10 —\nSkin fresheners 11 2 ≤0.1–10 —\nSkin care preparations (other) 2 — >1–10 4\nSuntan gels, creams, and liquids 2 3 >5–10 4\nIndoor tanning preps. 2 — >1–5 —\nSuntan preparations (other) — 1 — —\nTotal uses/ranges for Diisopropyl Adipate 112 66 ≤0.1–25 0.01–15\n∗These categories were combined when the original safety assessment was performed and are now separate categories.\nREFERENCES\nAstill, B.

In that report, the names for the ﬁrst three ingredients wasCandelilla Wax, Carnauba Wax, and Japan Wax, respectively.New studies given at the end of this section, along with updatedinformation regarding products in which these ingredients areused and at what concentrations, were considered by the CIRExpert Panel. The Panel determined to not reopen this safetyassessment.\nEuphorbia Cerifera (Candelilla) Wax was used in 1703\nproducts in 1976, mostly in lipsticks at a maximum concen-tration of 25%, although it was used in mascara products at amaximum concentration of 50% (Elder 1984). In 2002, this in-gredient reportedly had 701 uses (FDA 2002), mostly in lipsticksat a maximum current concentration of 27% (CTFA 2003)—nohigher current concentrations of use were reported.\nCopernica Cerifera (Carnauba) Wax was used in 2109\nproducts in 1976, again mostly in lipsticks at a maximum con-centration of 25%, although it was used in eye makeup productsat a maximum concentration of 50% (Elder 1984).

Newstudies, along with updated information regarding products inwhich these ingredients are used and at what concentrations wereconsidered by the CIR Expert Panel. The Panel determined to\nnot reopen this safety assessment.\nThe Panel did note that concentrations of use have increased\nfor this group of ingredients, but that the available safety testdata adequately address even these higher concentrations.\nIsobutane functions as a propellant in a wide variety of cos-\nmetic products. Historically, the highest concentration of use ofIsobutane in cosmetics was 50% in underarm deodorants. Cur-rently, the highest concentration of use of Isobutane is 83% inpowders. Historical and current uses of Isubutane in cosmeticproducts are listed in Table 12.\nIsopentane functions as a propellant, solvent, and a viscosity\ndecreasing agent in cosmetic products. Historically, the highest\nconcentration of use of Isopentane in cosmetics was 50% inother personal cleanliness products. Currently, the highest con-centration of use of Isopentane is 37% in underarm deodorants.Historical and current uses of Isopentane in cosmetic productsare listed in Table 12.\nn-Butane functions as a propellant in cosmetic products. His-\ntorically, the highest concentration of use of n-Butane in cosmet-ics was 25% in personal cleanliness products (other). Currently,\nthe highest concentration of use of n-Butane is 92% in underarm\ndeodorants. Historical and current uses of n-Butane in cosmeticproducts are listed in Table 12.\nPropane functions as a propellant in cosmetic products.

In 2002, Laureth-4 was reportedly used in 152 prepa-\nrations, with the largest single use in hair dyes and colors inthe concentration range of >10% to 25% (CTFA 2002). Data\nsubmitted in 2002 indicate the use of Laureth-4 in two addi-tional product categories, baby products and suntan products.Complete information is shown in Table 15.\nLaureth-23 was used in 218 products in 1981, with\nthe largest single use in permanent waves in the conce-\nTABLE 15\nHistorical and current cosmetic product uses and concentrations for Laureth-4 and Laureth-23\n1981 use 2002 use 1981 use concentrations 2002 use concentrations\nProduct category (Elder 1983) (FDA 2002) (Elder 1983) (%) (CTFA 2002) (%)\nLaureth-4\nBaby products (other) — 1 — 2Bath oils, tablets, and salts 5 3 >0.1–10 —\nBubble baths 1 — >1–5 3\nBath preparations (other) 2 1 >0.1–1 3\nEyeliner 1 9 >1–5 2\nEye shadow 85 12 >0.1–5 —\nEye makeup preparations — 3 — 2Powders — — — 0.004Fragrance preparations (other) — 2 — —Hair conditioners 2 7 >0.1–1 0.07–1\nHair sprays (aerosol ﬁxatives) 2 — ≤0.1 —\nPermanent waves 10 2 ≤0.1–1 —\nRinses (noncoloring) 6 5 ≤0.1–5 —\nShampoos (noncoloring) 4 8 >0.1–10 3\nHair tonics, dressings, etc. 2 1 >1–5 —\nWave sets 2 — ≤0.1–1 —\nHair preparations (other noncoloring) — 4 — —\nHair dyes and colors 17 27 >10–25 0.02–5\n(0.01–2.5 after dilution)\nHair bleaches 3 16 >0.1–25 —\nHair-coloring preparations (other) 1 — >1–5 —\nBlushers (all types) 4 19 >0.1–1 —\nFace powders — 2 — —Foundations 3 1 >0.1–1 0.5\nLipsticks — — — —Makeup bases 10 — >0.1–5 —\nRouges — 1 — —Makeup (other) 1 — ≤0.1 0.5\nNail creams and lotions 1 — >1–5 —\nNail polish and enamel — — — —Nail polish and enamel removers — — — —Nail care preparations (other) 1 — >1–5 5\nBath soaps and detergents — 2 — 0.4Underarm deodorants 15 6 >0.1–10 —\nPersonal cleanliness products (other) 6 7 >0.1–5 —\nAftershave lotion 1 2 >1–5 —\nBeard softeners 1 — >1–5 —\nShaving cream — — — 1–5Shaving preparation products (other) 1 1 >1–5 —\n(Continued on next page)ntration range of ≤0.1% to 5%.

New studies sincethen are listed at the end of this review. These new studies alongwith the updated information below regarding types and con-centrations of use were considered by the CIR Expert Panel.After this review, the Panel determined to not reopen the safetyassessment.\nMyristyl Myristate was used in 160 cosmetic preparations at\nconcentrations less than 0.1% to 25% in 1976. In 2002, MyristylMyristate was used in 244 cosmetic preparations with concen-trations of 0.01% to 20% (CTFA 2002; FDA 2002).\nThere were 26 new product categories in which there was use\nof Myristyl Myristate in 2002. In addition, use concentrationsincreased in the perfume and other fragrances categories.\nIsopropyl Myristate was reported in 2198 cosmetic formula-\ntions in 1976. In 2002, it was used in 881 cosmetic preparations.Five new categories were reported in 2002.\nIsopropyl Myristate had concentrations reported in 1976 that\nranged from less that 0.1% to greater than 50%. Concentrationof use increased from 1976 to 2002 in the following categories:eyeliner from 0.1–5% in 1976 to 31% in 2001, eye makeup\nremover from 1–50% to 78%, other manicuring preparations\nfrom 1–5% to 38%, and deodorant from 0.1–25% to 0.001–52%.\nTable 16 presents the historical and current use of Myristyl\nand Isopropy Myristate.64 COSMETIC INGREDIENT REVIEW\nTABLE 16\nHistorical and current

combined when the original safety assessment was performed and is now two separate categories.\n∗∗No longer considered a cosmetic product category.\nThe Panel considered data in the original safety assessment\nsuggesting that Isopropyl Myristate may be a tumor promoter.The CIR Expert Panel concluded that the data are more indica-tive of cocarcinogenesis in which Isopropyl Myristate has to beadministered with a carcinogen all of the time, but produces onlya slight enhancing effect. The large dose of Isopropyl Myristaterequired in order to bring about a cocarcinogenic effect suggeststhat, under cosmetic use conditions, no enhancing or potentiat-ing effect of Isopropyl Myristate would be anticipated.\nThe Panel did recall the data in the original safety assessment\nregarding the comedogenicity of Isopropyl Myristate, data thathave been conﬁrmed in subsequent studies, and reminded for-mulators to consider this, especially in view of the increase inuse concentration from 1976 to 2002 in eye products.\nREFERENCES\nBechgaard, E. 1985.

New studies listed at the end of this section,with updated information regarding types and concentrationsof use, were considered by the CIR Expert Panel. The Paneldetermined to not reopen this safety assessment.\nOzokerite was used in 1269 cosmetic products in 1976, with\nthe largest use occurring in moisturizing products at concen-trations of >1% to 50%. In 2002, Ozokerite was used in 680\ncosmetic products (FDA 2002), at a maximum use concentra-tion of 22% in other eye makeup preparations (CTFA 2003).\nCeresin was used in 403 cosmetic products in 1976, with the\nlargest use occurring in makeup bases; rouges; other makeuppreparations; cleansing; face, body, and hand skin care; moistur-izing; night, wrinkle smoothers; and other skin care preparationsat concentrations of ≤25%. In 2002, Ceresin was used in 404\ncosmetic products (FDA 2002), at a maximum use concentrationof 20% in other makeup preparations and suntan gels, creams,and liquids (CTFA 2003).\nMontan Wax was used in 355 cosmetic products in 1976,\nwith the largest use occurring in eyebrow pencil and lipsticksat concentrations of >0.1% to 25%.

New studies since then (listed atthe end of this review), along with the updated information belowregarding types and concentrations of use, were considered bythe CIR Expert Panel. The Panel determined not to reopen thissafety assessment.\nIn 1976 Polyamino Sugar Condensate was reported to be\nused in 111 cosmetic preparations with the largest single use\noccurring in moisturizers at concentrations of ≤0.1% to 1%. As\nreported to the FDA (FDA 2001), Polyamino Sugar Condensateis currently used in 25 cosmetic preparations; however, accord-ing to an industry survey (CTFA 2001), Polyamino Sugar Con-densate is not currently used in cosmetic preparations. Table 19presents the available use information.\nA study by Peterson et al. (1986) demonstrated that Polyamino\nSugar Condensate was absorbed into the stratum corneum andepidermis of athymic nude mice grafted with human skin. Al-though this information was new, the Expert Panel noted thatPolyamino Sugar Condensate is a sugar–amino acid expectedto be metabolized to sugars and amino acids. Because the origi-nal safety assessment fully discussed the potential production ofnitrosamines during the manufacture of Polyamino Sugar Con-densate, no further discussion was warranted.\nREFERENCES\nCTFA. 2002.

The only new information related to these compoundsis the updated frequency of use, as voluntarily reported by theindustry to the FDA and shown in Table 22. The CIR ExpertPanel considered these new uses and determined to not reopenthis safety assessment.\nPotassium-Coco-Hydrolyzed Animal Protein was used in 251\ncosmetic products in 1981, with the highest concentration at50% in non-coloring shampoos. In 2002, Potassium Cocoyl Hy-drolyzed Collagen was used in 64 cosmetic products, with thehighest concentration at 20% in noncoloring shampoo.\nTriethanolamine-Coco-Hydrolyzed was used in 18 cosmetic\nproducts in 1981, with the highest concentration at 50% innoncoloring shampoos. In 2002, Triethanolamine Cocoyl Hy-drolyzed Collagen was reported to FDA as used in 21 cosmetic\nproducts (FDA 2002), but an industry survey of current use con-centrations did not provide any information (CTFA 2002).\nThe CIR Expert Panel acknowledged the new use of Tri-\nethanolamine Cocoyl Hydrolyzed Collagen in aerosol hairsprays. The effects of inhaled aerosols depend on the speciﬁc\nchemical species, the concentration, the duration of exposure,and site of deposition within the respiratory system. Particle sizeis the most important factor affecting the location of deposition(Jensen and O’Brien 1993). The mean aerodynamic diameter ofpump hair spray particles is ≥80μ, and the diameter of anhy-\ndrous hair spray particles is 60 to 80 μ. Typically less than 1%\nare below 10 μ, which is the upper limit for respirable parti-\ncles (Bower 1999). Based on the particle size, TriethanolamineCocoyl Hydrolyzed Collagen would not be respirable in formu-lation. Therefore, the Panel was not concerned about the lack ofinhalation toxicity data.\nThe Panel also noted that the hydrolyzed protein would not\nabsorb into human tissues, thus further reducing the risk oftoxicity.84 COSMETIC INGREDIENT REVIEW\nTABLE 22\nHistoric and current use of Potassium Cocoyl Hydrolyzed Collagen and Triethanolamine (TEA) Cocoyl Hydrolyzed Collagen\n1976 use 2001 uses\nconcentrations concentrations\n1976 uses 2001 uses (Elder 1983) (CTFA 2002)\nProduct type (Elder 1983) (FDA 2001) (%) (%)\nPotassium Cocoyl Hydrolyzed Collagen\nBubble baths 6 — >1–5 —\nBath preparations (other) 1 — >1–5 —\nHair conditioners 4 — >1–10 —\nHair straighteners 12 2 ≤0.1–1 —\nPermanent waves 55 18 ≤0.1–5 1\nShampoos (noncoloring) 33 6 ≤0.1–50 1–20\nHair tonics, dressings, etc. 6 2 ≤0.1–5 —\nWave sets 1 — >1–5 —\nHair preparations (other noncoloring) 3 1 >1–5 —\nHair dyes and colors 43 21 >1–10 5\nHair tints — 9 — —\nHair lighteners with color 1 — >1–5 —\nHair bleaches 1 — >1–5 —\nNail creams and lotions — — — 0.05Nail polish and enamel 74 — ≤0.1 —\nManicuring preparations (other) 6 — ≤0.1–5 —\nShaving preparations (other) — 1 — —Skin cleansing creams, lotions, liquids, and pads 3 3 >1–50 —\nFace and neck skin care preparations — —1\n∗>1–5∗\nBody and hand skin care preparations — —\nMoisturizers — 1 — 0.2\nSkin care preparations (other) 1 — >0.1–1 —\nTotal uses/ranges for Potassium Cocoyl 251 64 ≤0.1–50 0.05–20\nHydrolyzed Collagen\nTriethanolamine (TEA) Cocoyl Hydrolyzed Collagen\nBaby shampoos — 1 — —Bath oils, tablets, and salts — 1 — —Bubble Baths — 3 — 1Perfumes — 1 — —Hair conditioners 3 1 >1–5 —\nHair sprays (aerosol ﬁxatives) — 1 — —Permanent waves — 2 — —\nShampoos (noncoloring) 11 3 ≤0.1–50 —\nHair tonics, dressings, etc. 1 — >1–5 —\nFoundations — 1 — —Cuticle softeners 1 — ≤0.1 —\nBath soaps and detergents 1 — >1–5 —\nPersonal cleanliness products (other) — 1 — —Shaving cream — 1 — —Skin-cleansing creams, lotions, liquids, and pads — 4 — —Skin care preparations (other) 1 — >1–5 —\nTotal uses/ranges for Triethanolamine (TEA) 18 20 0.1–50 —\nCocoyl Hydrolyzed Collagen\n∗This category was combined when the original safety assessment was performed and is now two separate categories.SAFETY ASSESSMENTS: 2002/2003 85\nAs with all cosmetic ingredients derived from animal tissues,\nPotassium Cocoyl Hydrolyzed Collagen and TriethanolamineCocoyl Hydrolyzed Collagen, as used in cosmetic products,must be free of detectable pathogenic viruses, prions, or otherpathogenic agents.\nREFERENCES\nBower, D. 1999.

In products intended for prolonged con-tact with skin, concentrations should not exceed 1%.”\nOver 250 scientiﬁc research studies conducted since the orig-\ninal safety assessment was published are listed at the end of thisreview. These new studies, along with the updated informationbelow regarding types and concentrations of use, were consid-ered by the CIR Expert Panel. In addition, the Panel acknowl-edged the Internet rumor that these ingredients are carcinogenic.\nAfter this review, however, the Panel determined to not reopenthis safety assessment.\nSLS was used in 703 cosmetic products in 1981, with the\nhighest usage in the noncoloring shampoo category at a max-imum concentration of >50%. SLS currently is used in 1018\ncosmetic products, with the single largest use in hair dyes andcolors, at concentrations from 0.2% to 20%. The maximum cur-rent concentration of SLS is 50%, in noncoloring shampoos.Table 25 presents the available use information for SLS.\nAmmonium Lauryl Sulfate was used in 164 cosmetic prod-\nucts in 1981, with the highest concentration range from >0.1% to\n50% in noncoloring shampoos. Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate cur-rently is used in 306 cosmetic products, with the single largestuse in non-coloring shampoos at a maximum concentration of55%. Table 25 also includes the available use information forAmmonium Lauryl Sulfate.\nThe CIR Expert Panel discussion focused on the skin ir-\nritation, penetration enhancement, and potential carcinogenicactivity of these ingredients. New studies conﬁrmed the irri-tant properties of these ingredients and reinforced concentra-tion limit of 1% for leave-on uses established by the Panel.Moreover, the Panel noted that SLS and Ammonium LaurylSulfate may increase the penetration of other cosmetic ingredi-ents, and suggested that this information should be consideredduring formulation.\nThe available studies that looked for carcinogenesis failed\nto ﬁnd any evidence that Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate are90 COSMETIC INGREDIENT REVIEW\nTABLE 25\nHistorical and current use of Sodium Lauryl Sulfate and Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate\n1981 use 2002 uses\nconcentrations concentrations\n1981 uses 2002 uses (Elder 1983) (CTFA 2002)\nProduct type (Elder 1983) (FDA 2002) (%) (%)\nSodium Lauryl Sulfate\nBaby shampoos 2 — >1–5 3\nBath oils, tablets, and salts 7 8 >1–>50 —\nBubble baths 73 48 >0.1–50 10–14\nBath capsules 2 1 >5–10 —\nBath preparations (other) 24 24 >0.1–50 2–20\nEyebrow pencils 2 — >1–5 0.2\nEyeliners — 3 — 0.08–0.2Eye shadow — — — 0.05\nEye makeup remover 2 — >1–5 0.2\nMascara 9 13 ≤0.1–1 0.06–0.2\nEye makeup (other) – 9 — 0.3Sachets 20 — >0.1–1 0.3\nFragrance preparations (other) 3 2 ≤0.1–10 —\nHair conditioners 6 9 >0.1–25 0.1\nHair straighteners 9 12 >0.1–5 —\nPermanent waves 9 1 ≤0.1–10 0.1\nRinses (noncoloring) 1 — >0.1–1 —\nShampoos (noncoloring) 226 181 ≤0.1–>50 5–50\nHair tonics, dressings, etc. 2 — >0.1–50 0.2\nWave sets — 1 — —Hair preparations (other noncoloring) 6 5 ≤0.1–5 —\nHair dyes and colors 61 349 ≤0.1–5 0.2–20\nHair tints 1 — >1–5 0.02–0.2\nHair rinses (coloring) — — — 0.4Shampoos (coloring) 9 2 >1–50 —\nHair lighteners with color — 1 — —Hair bleaches 21 18 ≤0.1–25 0.4–2\nHair-coloring preparations (other) 5 5 ≤0.1–10 3\nBlushers (all types) 1 — >0.1–1 —\nFoundations 14 11 ≤0.1–1 0.2–1.4\nMakeup bases 8 10 ≤0.1–1 0.8\nRouges 1 — >0.1–1 —\nMakeup (other) — 1 — 2Cuticle softeners 1 — >0.1–1 —\nNail creams and lotions — 1 — —Nail polish and enamel — — — 0.01Manicuring preparations (other) 1 2 >0.1–1 0.01\nDentifrices 28 34 >0.1–10 1–8\nMouthwashes and breath fresheners 4 5 >0.1–1 —\nOral hygiene products (other) 2 1 >0.1–5 —\nBath soaps and detergents 11 53 ≤0.1–50 0.01–11\nUnderarm deodorants 6 4\n>0.1–1 1\nDouches 1 — >1–5 —\n(Continued on next page)SAFETY ASSESSMENTS: 2002/2003 91\nTABLE 25\nHistorical and current use of Sodium Lauryl Sulfate and Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate (Continued)\n1981 use 2002 uses\nconcentrations concentrations\n1981 uses 2002 uses (Elder 1983) (CTFA 2002)\nProduct type (Elder 1983) (FDA 2002) (%) (%)\nPersonal cleanliness products (other) 7 20 >0.1–>50 10–11\nAftershave lotions 2 1 >0.1–1 —\nPreshave lotions — — — 3\nShaving cream 5 36 >0.1–5 0.9–5∗\nShaving preparations (other) — — — —\nSkin-cleansing creams, lotions, liquids, and pads 28 45 ≤0.1–50 3–10\nDepilatories 8 5 ≤0.1–10 0.02\nFace and neck skin care preparations 4 0.327∗∗≤0.1–5∗∗\nBody and hand skin care preparations 35 0.06–0.3\nFoot powders and sprays — 2 — 0.3Moisturizers 23 25 ≤0.1–1 0.2\nNight skin care preparations 4 1 ≤0.1–5 —\nPaste masks/mud packs 9 4 ≤0.1–5 2\nSkin fresheners 1 1 >0.1–1 —\nSkin care preparations (other) 6 19 ≤0.1–5 0.01–5\nSuntan gels, creams, and liquids 4 2 ≤0.1–1 —\nIndoor tanning preparations — 1 — —Suntan preparations (other) 2 3 ≤0.1–1 —\nTotal uses/ranges for Sodium Lauryl Sulfate 703 1018 ≤0.1–>50 0.01–50\nAmmonium Lauryl Sulfate\nBaby shampoos 2 — >10–25 —\nBath oils, tablets, and salts 1 — >25–50 —\nBubble baths 19 5 >5–50 10–12\nBath preparations (other) - 4 — 10–45Fragrance preparations (other) — — — 12\n∗\nHair conditioners — 2 — —Rinses (noncoloring) — 3 — —\nShampoos (noncoloring) 131 242 >0.1–50 8–55\nHair tonics, dressings, etc. — 1 — —Hair preparations (other) — 8 — —Hair dyes and colors — 1 — —Hair rinses (coloring) — 14 — —Hair shampoos (coloring) 2 1 >10–25 —\nBath soaps and detergents 4 14 >10–50 5–47\nPersonal cleanliness products (other) — 2 — 3–12\nSkin-cleansing creams, lotions, liquids, and pads 4 8 >1–50 10\nSkin care preparations (other) 1 1 >0.1–1 —\nTotal uses/ranges for Ammonium Lauryl Sulfate 164 306 >0.1–50 3–55\n∗Speciﬁed as a rinse-off product.\n∗∗These categories were combined when the original safety assessment was performed and are now two separate categories.92 COSMETIC INGREDIENT REVIEW\ncarcinogenic.

These new studies, along with the updatedinformation regarding types and concentrations of use, were con-sidered by the CIR Expert Panel. The Panel determined to notreopen this safety assessment.\nThe number of cosmetic formulations using Prunus Amygdalus\nDulcis Oil reported to the FDA increased from 280 in 1976 to375 in 2002. Concentration of use has not changed appreciably,although there was a reported use of sweet almond oil at 76% ina manicuring product. In addition, the Panel noted new uses inbaby products, hair sprays, and eye preparations. The numberof cosmetic formulations using Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis SeedMeal reported to the FDA decreased from 16 in 1976 to 15 in2002, with not signiﬁcant change in use concentration. Table 26provides the historic and current product uses and concentra-tions for Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis Oil and Prunus AmygdalusDulcis Seed Meal.\nRegarding use in hair sprays, the Panel noted that inhalation\ntoxicity data are not included in the original report. A new studyin which almond oil, in a nasal spray, was administered to female\nsubjects, without evident toxicity to the lungs, indicates thatSweet Almond Oil and Sweet Almond Seed Meal could be usedsafely in a hair spray.\nThe effects of inhaled aerosols depends on the speciﬁc chem-\nical species, the concentration, the duration of exposure, andsite of deposition within the respiratory system. Particle size isthe most important factor affecting the location of deposition(Jensen and O’Brien 1993). The mean aerodynamic diameterof pump hair spray particles is ≤80μand the diameter of an-\nhydrous spray particles is 60 to 80 μ. Typically, less than 1%\nare below 10 μwhich is the upper limit for respirable particles\n(Bower 1999). Based on the particle size, Sweet Almond Oiland Sweet Almond Seed Meal in aerosol formulations wouldnot be respirable in formulation.\nAs with the use of all plant-derived cosmetic ingredients,\nthe Panel also reminded manufacturers that cosmetic products\nshould be formulated to limit the presence of heavy metal/pesticide residues as follows: lead ≤0.1 ppm; arsenic ≤3 ppm;\nmercury ≤1 ppm; and total PCB/pesticide contamination ≤40\nppm, with ≤10 ppm for any speciﬁc residue.\nREFERENCES\nBeisson, F., N.

The Panel determined to notreopen this safety assessment.\nThe name of Vinyl Acetate/Crotonic Acid Copolymer as\nlisted in the International Cosmetic Ingredient Dictionary and\nHandbook , 9th edition, has been changed to V A/Crotonates Copoly-\nmer (Pepe et al. 2002).\nV A/Crotonates Copolymer was used in 55 cosmetic products\nin 1976, with the largest use occurring in hair sprays at concen-trations of >0.01% to 25%. In 2002, V A/Crotonates Copolymer\nwas used in 38 cosmetic products (FDA 2002), at a maximum\nuse concentration of 11% in hair sprays (CTFA 2002b). Table 27presents the available use information for V A/CrotonatesCopolymer.The CIR Expert Panel acknowledged the use of Vinyl\nAcetate/Crotonic Acid Copolymer in aerosol hair sprays. The ef-fects of inhaled aerosols depend on the speciﬁc chemical species,the concentration, the duration of exposure, and site of deposi-tion within the respiratory system. Particle size is the most im-portant factor affecting the location of deposition (Jensen andO’Brien 1993). The mean aerodynamic diameter of pump hairspray particles is ≥80μ, and the diameter of anhydrous hair\nspray particles is 60 to 80 μ. Typically less than 1% are below\n10μ, which is the upper limit for respirable particles (Bower\n1999). Based on the particle size, Vinyl Acetate/Crotonic AcidCopolymer would not be respirable in formulation.\nAlthough there were reports associating vinyl acetate with\nnasopharyngeal carcinoma in rat inhalation studies, studies showthat the reported carcinogenicity of vinyl acetate in rats is througha nongenotoxic mechanism, and the amount of residual vinylacetate monomer in V A/Crotonates Copolymer was below theno-observed-effect level. Conﬁrming this, occupational studiesin which workers were exposed to vinyl acetate ranging from 5to 10 ppm, with intermittent exposures near 50 ppm and acuteexposures to 300 ppm, showed no long-term chronic effects.\nREFERENCES\nBogdanffy, M.

Most of these ingredients \nare reported to function as skin and hair conditioning agents.  The Panel reviewed relevant new data, including frequency and \nconcentration of use, as well as exposure type, and considered data from the previous report.  The Panel concluded that these \ningredients are safe in cosmetics  in the present practices of use and concentration described in this safety  assessment  when \nformulated to be non -irritating , with the exception that the available data are insufficient to make a determination of safety \nfor use of these ingredients in products that may be incidentally inhaled when applied using airbrush devices . \nINTRODUCTION  \nIn 2003, the Expert Panel for Cosmetic Ingredient Safety (Panel) published a final repo rt on the safety assessment of 20 \ndimethicone, methicone, and substituted -methicone polymers.1  Based on the available data, the Panel concluded that the  \ningre dients named in that report are safe as used in cosmetic products.  In accordance with the Cosmetic Ingredient Review \n(CIR) Procedures, the Panel evaluates the conclusions of previously -issued reports approximately every 15 years.  In \nDecember 2019, the Pa nel determined that this safety assessment should be re- opened due to an increase in the overall \nfrequency of use for ingredients in this group.  T he Panel also determined that it is appropriate to include an additional 10 \nalkyl dimethicone and methicone i ngredients  (denoted in red  below) ; the complete family of 30 ingredients comprises :   \nAmino Bispropyl Dimethicone  \nAminopropyl Dimethicone  \nAmodimethicone  \nAmodimethicone Hydroxystearate \nBehenoxy Dimethicone  \nC20-24 Alkyl Dimethicone  \nC20-24 Alkyl Methicone  \nC24-28 Alkyl Dimethicone  \nC24-28 Alkyl Methicone  \nC26-28 Alkyl Dimethicone  \nC26-28 Alkyl Methicone  \nC30-45 Alkyl Dimethicone  \nC30-45 Alkyl Methicone  \nC30-60 Alkyl Dimethicone  \nC32 Alkyl Dimethicone  \n \n Capryl Dimethicone  \nCaprylyl Methicone  \nCetearyl Methicone  \nCetyl Dimethicone  \nDimethicone  \nDimethoxysilyl Ethylenediaminopropyl Dimethicone  \nHexyl Dimethicone  \nHexyl Methicone  \nHydroxypropyldimethicone  \nMethicone  \nStearamidopropyl Dimethicone  \nStearoxy Dimethicone  \nStearyl Dimethicone  \nStearyl Methicone  \nVinyl Dimethicone  \n \nAccording to the web-based International Cosmetic Ingredient Dictionary and Handbook  (wINCI; Dictionary ), the \nmajority of the ingredients included in this assessment  are reported to function as skin and/or  hair conditioning  agents .2  \nAdditional functions are also reported for some ingredients ( Table 1).   \nExcerpts from the summary of the 2003 report a re included throughout the text of this re -review document, as \nappropriate, and are identified by italicized text.  (This information is not included in the Summary section.)  For complete \nand detailed information, please refer to the  original report on the methicone polymer ingredients , which  can be accessed on \nthe CIR website ( https://www.cir -safety.org/ingredients ). \nThis safety assessment includes relevant published and unpublished data that are available for each endpoint that is \nevaluated.  Published data are identified by conducting an exhaustive search of the world’s literature.  A listing of the search \nengines and websites that are used  and the sources that are typically explored, as well as th e endpoints that the Panel typically \nevaluates, is provided on the CIR website ( https://www.cir -safety.org/supplementaldoc/preliminary -search -engines -and-\nwebsites; https://www.cir -safety.org/supplementaldoc/cir -report -format -outline ).  Unpublished data are provided by the \ncosmetics industry, as well as by other interested parties .  Much of the data included in this safety assessment was found in an \nEuropean Centre for Ecotoxicology and Toxicology of Chemicals (ECETOC) report , on the European Chemicals Agency \n(ECHA) website, and in Australian Industrial Chemicals Introduction Sc heme (AICIS) assessments .3-7  Please note that the  \ntoxicolog ical studies described in th ese documents  were summaries  and it is , therefore,  these summary data that are reported \nwhen cited in  this safety assessment . \nCHEMISTRY  \nDefinition  and Structure  \nThe ingredients in this report are all  siloxane polymers.  Each silicone atom is further substituted with hydrogen, \nmethyl, or other substituents  (Figure 1) .  For Methicone (CAS No. 9004- 73-3), most of the silicone atoms in the polymer backbone each have 1 methyl group and 1 hydrogen atom, whi le for Dimethicone (CAS No. 9006- 65-9), most silicone atoms \nin the polymer back bone have 2 methyl substituents.  The remaining ingredients in this report have 1 or 2 of the substituent s \non the silicone atoms replaced with an alternative functional group (e.g., Hexyl Methicone (CAS No. 1873- 90-1) is \nsubstituted with hexyl  (C6) chains , and Amodimethicone  (CAS No. 68554- 54-1) has a nitrogen substituent) .  The d efinitions  \nand idealized structures  of all the ingredients included in this report are provided in  Table 1.  \n \n \nFigure 1 .  Meth icones, wherein R is hydrogen, methyl, or other substituents  \nThe polymerization of linear methicones , however,  often results in a mixture of  polymers (chains of variable lengths \nand molecular weights, including oligomers) and cyclic compounds.8  Dimethicone is a mixture of fully methylated linear \nsiloxane polymers end -blocked with trimethylsiloxy units.2  Methicone is a linear monomethyl polysiloxane.  The other \ningredients included  in this review are siloxane polymers of Dimethicone and Methicone.  \nViscosity is expressed in both dynamic and kinematic measurements , and is directly correlated with molecular weight \nand the degree of polymerization  of a molecule , i.e., the longer the polymer chains, the more viscous the liquid polymer .3 \nMost  of the  viscosities reported in previous and current data  have been described in kinematic centistokes (cSt; cm2/s), and \nare converted to the standard , dynamic,  Pascal*second  (Pa⋅s; kg/m⋅s), where specific gravity , or relative density , values were \navailable.  To do this, the product of centistoke and specific gravity, or relative density, values, was divided by 1000, to attain \nPa⋅s values.  Specifically, a median reported relative density value of 950 has been used for the conversion of Dimethicone \nsamples de scribed in the ECETOC report.3 \nChemical Properties  \nDimethicone is a white, almost odorless fluid polymer.1  Specifications for Dimethicone state d that the color and odor \nare specified by the buyer.  Also specified by the buyer are the refractive index at 25 °C (within the range of 1.4000 to \n1.4035), and the kinematic viscosity (provided that the specified mean viscosity at 25 °C is not less than 20 centistokes [cs] \nand not greater than ±  5% of the specified mean).  It contains 98.5% to 101.1% Dimethicone and the total acid number is \n0.01 maximum.   One supplier of Dimethicone noted that 100 and 350 cs fluids are generally used for cosmetics.  \nC30-45 A lkyl Dimethicone  \nC30-45 Alkyl Dimethicone is a an off -white solid, which occurs in small pellets, at standard temperature and pressure.4  \nThis ingredient has a melting point of 63  - 74 °C and is considered insoluble in  water.  \nCaprylyl Methicone  \nAt atmospheric pressure, Caprylyl Methicone is a liquid at 20 ° C, has a melting/freezing point at - 20 °C, a boiling point \nat 263 ° C, and a calculated partition coefficient (log P ow) of 9 at 20 ° C.6  This ingredient  also has a molecular weight of 335 \ng/mol, a relative density of 0.84 at 20  °C, a viscosity of 0.0027 kg/m ⋅s at 20 ° C, a vapor pressure of 0.64 Pa at 25  °C, and a \nwater solubility of 2.8  x 10-5 mg/l. \nHexyl Methicone  \nAt atmospheric pressure, Hexyl Methicone is a liquid at 20  °C, has a melting/freezing point at < - 20 °C, a boiling point \nat 232  °C, and a log P ow  > 6.2 at 40  °C.7  Additionally, Hexyl Methicone has a relative density of 0.83 at 20  °C and a  water \nsolubility of 0.011 mg/ l at 20  °C. \nMethod of Manufacture  \nStearoxy Di methicone is produced by the reaction of dichloropolydimethylsiloxane with stearyl alcohol.1  Dimethicone \nis produced by polymerization/equilibration.  Cetyl Dimethicone is produced by hydrosilylation of C 16 alpha- olefins.  Stearyl \nDimethicone is produced by h ydrosilylation of C 18 alpha- olefins .  \nNo additional methods of manufacture data  were found in the published literature, and unpublished data were not \nsubmitted.  \nImpurities  \nOne supplier of these ingredients noted that Stearoxy Dimethicone, Dimethicone, Cetyl Dimethicone, and Stearyl \nDimethicone  contain no antioxidants or preservatives.1  Heavy metals are at 5 ppm maximum, and D4/D5 cyclomethicone is \nat less than 1%.  \nC30-45 Alkyl Dimethicone  \nThe Australian National Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Scheme  (NICNAS ) noted that C30 -45 Alkyl \nDimethicone can potentially contain residual monomers which are classified as hazardous according to the Globally \nHarmonised System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS) .4  As per Australian chemical manufacturing \nguidelines , howeve r, these are not present above the cut off concentrations for classification . \nNo additional impurities  data were found in the published literature, and unpublished data were not submitted.  \nUSE  \nCosmetic  \nThe safety of the cosmetic ingredients addressed in this assessment is evaluated based on data received from the US \nFood and Drug Administration (FDA) and the cosmetics industry on the expected use of these ingredients in cosmetics.  Use \nfrequencies of individual ingredients in cosmetics are collected from ma nufacturers and reported by cosmetic product \ncategory in the FDA Voluntary Cosmetic Registration Program (VCRP) database.  The cosmetic product categories named in \nthe VCRP database indicate the intended uses of cosmetic ingredients, and are identified in 21 CFR Part 720.   Data are \nsubmitted by the cosmetic industry in response to a survey conducted by the Personal Care Products Council (Council) of \nmaximum reported use concentrations , also by product category.  Neither the categories provided by the VCRP, nor those \nprovided by the Council survey, include a designation for use via  airbrush application .  Airbrush devices , alone , are within \nthe purview of the US Consumer Product Safety Commission ( CPSC) , while ingredients used in airbrush devices are within \nthe jurisdiction of the FDA.  As airbrush technology use for cosmetics has neither  been evaluated by the CPSC, nor the use of \ncosmetic ingredients in airbrush technology by the FDA,  no US regulatory authority has evaluated the safety of this delivery \nmethodology for cosmetic ingredients.   Moreover, no consumer habits and practices data are available to evaluate the risks \nassociated with this use type.   \nFrequency of use has generally increased for these ingredients  since they were originally reviewed , with some of the \nincreases being quite significant.  According to VCRP data, the frequency of use of Dimethicone has increased from 1659 \nreported uses in 1998 to 7747 reported uses in 20 22, and the number of uses reported for Methicone increased from 0 \nreported uses in 1998 to 678 uses reported in 2022 ( Table 2).1,9  Of the ingredients not previously reviewed , Caprylyl \nMethicone has the highest overall frequency of use ( 200).9    \nThe overall maximum concentrations of use of these ingredients have not increased substantially; however, increases in \nconcentrations of use , according to exposure type , are notable.  Specifically, the reported maximum c oncentration of use of \nDimethicone only increased from 80% to 85%, and yet, use in products resulting in dermal contact increased from 30% to \n85%. Additionally , use in formulations applied  near the eye increased from 13% in eyebrow pencils to 37.8% in eyeliners , \nand use  in products that can result in incidental ingestion ( lipstick s) increased from  20% to 71.3% .  Of the ingredients not \npreviously reviewed, Caprylyl Methicone has the highest maximum concentration of use , at up to 16% in eye lotions.10  Ten \ningredients are not reported to be in use, according to VCRP and industry survey data  (Table 3 ).  \nUse in products that can result in in cidental inhalation increased from 16% in perfume sprays to 85% in moisturizing \nsprays  and from 30% to 53% in face powders .  In practice, as stated in the Panel’s respiratory exposure resource document \n(https://www.cir -safety.org/cir -findings ), most droplets/particles incidentally inhaled from cosmetic sprays would be \ndeposited in the nasopharyngeal and tracheobronchial regions and would not be respira ble (i.e., they would not enter the \nlungs) to any appreciable amount.  Some of these ingredients are used in spray deodorants (e.g., Dimethicone at up to \n18.6%).  T here is some evidence indicating that deodorant spray products can release substantially larger fractions of \nparticulates having aerodynamic equivalent diameters in the range considered to be respirable.  However, the information is \nnot sufficient to determine whether significantly greater lung exposures result from the use of deodorant sprays, compared to other cosmetic sprays.  Conservative estimates of inhalation exposures to respirable particles during the use of loose powder cosmetic products are 400 -fold to 1000- fold less than protective regulatory and guidance limits for inert airborne resp irable \nparticles in the workplace.  \nFurthermore , in addition to use in formulations that may result in  incidental inhalation (i.e., from sprays and powders ), \nthe Panel was informed  that some of the ingredients in this report are used in cosmetic products which are applied with \nairbrush devices.11-13  Although products containing so me of these ingredients may be  marketed for use with airbrush \ntechnology, this information is not available from the VCRP or the Council survey .  Without information regarding the \nfrequency and  concentrations of use of these ingredients  (and without consumer habits and practices data related to this use \ntechnology) , the data are insufficient to  evaluate the safety thereof in airbrush applications . The ingredients named in this report are not restricted from use in any way under the rules  governing cosmetic products \nin the European Union.14 \nNon-Cosmetic  \nDimethicone  \nThe allowable concentration of use of Dimethicone as an active ingredient in the formulation of skin protectant drug \nproducts for over -the-counter human use is 1 - 30%.  [21 CFR § 347.10]  Dimethicone has b een used as a physical barrier \nmethod of eradicating head lice and eggs.15,16  Dimethicone use is also prevalent in condom lubricants .3,17  Dimethicone  is \nalso used industrially, in various construction sealants, rubber, and paints.3 \nIn 2008,  at the Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) of the World Health Organization ( WHO), the \nestablished acceptable daily intake (ADI) level for Dimethicone of 0 - 1.5 mg/kg was withdrawn due to variability in safety \ndata, and was temporarily replaced with 0 - 0.8 mg/kg, while concerns about ocular toxicity resulting from molecular weight \nand viscosity -dependent absorption and toxicity were evaluated.18  As of 2011, the original ADI of 0 - 1.5 mg/kg was \nreinstated.18 \nTOXICOKINETIC  STUDIES  \nPenetration  \nCaprylyl Methicone  \nThe dermal penetration of Caprylyl Methicone is deemed unlikely due to a low water solubility and a n estimated  log \nPow of 9.6 \nDimethicone  \nPenetration  of Dimethicone ( 9.5 kg/m⋅s and 332.5 kg/m⋅s) was examined in female human abdominal skin and vaginal \ntissue.3  Both viscosities were applied in infinite doses for 96 h to the donor side of split -thickness human abdominal skin \nsections (reference standard) and full -thickness human vaginal tissue mounted in Franz in vitro  diffusion cells .   (The \nidentification of the vehicle and receptor fluid was not provided.)  The dermal flux rate for Dimethicone ( 332.5 kg/m⋅s) in \nabdominal skin was 0.3 ng/cm2/h, compared to 2 ng/cm2/h for vaginal tissue; while the flux rates for Dimethicone  (9.5 \nkg/m⋅s) in abdominal skin were 0.2 ng/cm2/h and 6 ng/cm2/h for vaginal tissue.  The authors concluded that there was a low \npenetratio n rate, which o ccurred more rapidly in vaginal tissue, for both viscosities.  \nIn a dermal penetration study, the authors sought to determine  if Dimethicone  interact s with and alter s the stratum \ncorneum lipid microstructure.19  Excised human stratum corneum tissue samples were obtained from the inner thigh of a \nhealthy 5 0 yr-old woman and the abdomen of a healthy 26 yr -old man.  An in vitro model lipid system containing stratum \ncorneum fatty acids was also used to mimic the skin barrier.  These tissue samples were rinsed with 0.001% m/m trypsin \ninhibitor and stored for 48 h in 76% humidity , at ambient temperature, to achieve an approximately 20% hydration level.  \nThe hydrated samples were then treated for 20 min in various viscosities of excess Dimethicone  (332.5, 475, 950, or 19,000 \nkg/m⋅s) at 37  ºC, removed with a cellulose tissue, and analyzed for change using thermal profile, x -ray diffraction, polarized \nlight microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy.   All results indicated that Dimethicone  did not disturb or interact \nwith the liquid cr ystalline structure of the upper layer of the epidermis, and hence is not likely to penetrate the skin barrier.  \nAbsorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and Excretion (ADME)  \nSeveral acute pharmacokinetic studies in dogs, rats, and a monkey  reported minimal gastrointestinal absorption of \nDimethicone and up to 99.99% recovery of the administered dose via excretion.1 In a repeated dose study, beagle dogs wer e \nfed 91% Dimethicone at a dose of 300 mg/kg/d for 120 d in the diet.  Although one female showed atrophy of the spleen, and \nanother female had slightly reddened rugae near the stomach and mucus in the intestine, Dimethicone was not detected in \nany organs  or considered absorbed.    \nAnimal  \nDimethicone  \nIn a study examining dermal absorption and distribution, an occlusive patch containing [14C]Dimethicone ( 332.5 \nkg/m⋅s) was applied to male CD rats (number not provided) for 24 h.3  After the initial 24 -h exposure period, animals were \nremoved from th e metabolism cages, the occlusive patch was removed, and the exposure site was washed.  The animals were \nre-wrapped with a non- occlusive bandage and returned to metabolism caging for continued monitoring and collection of \nbiologic samples.  The animals were killed 72 h after their initial exposure and the exposure sites were carefully excised.  Radioactivity tracing demonstrated that 70% of the administered dose was found on the patch materials, 11.4% was present at \nthe site of application, and none was fou nd in the blood.  Minimal amounts were found in the feces (0.01%) and carbon \ndioxide traps (0.001%).  Human  \nIn human studies, absorption was seen in humans following ingestion of a Dimethicone sample containing low -\nmolecular -weight polymers.1  Dermal upper back  exposure to Dimethicone for 10 d did not increase blood or urine silicone \nconcentrations in men.  \nCaprylyl Methicone  \nAccording to an estimated blood: air  partition coefficient of 1.7 x 10-4:1 for human inhalation, systemic circulation  of \nCaprylyl Methicone is not likely .6,20  Based on an algorithm,21 the soluble fraction of Caprylyl Methicone in the blood is \n<< 1%, suggesting the minimal likelihood of this ingredient being excreted in urine as water -soluble metabolites.    \nTOXICOLOGICAL STUDIES \nAcute Toxicity Studies  \nDermal  \nThe dermal LD 50 for Dimethicone was >  2000 mg/kg in rats and rabbits.1  The dermal LD 50 for Methicone was >  20 \nml/kg in rabbits.  The dermal LD 50 for Vinyl D imethicone was >  16 ml/kg in rabbits.    \nC30-45 Alkyl Dimethicone  \n An acute dermal exposure study  with C30-45 Alkyl Dimethicone was performed , in rats, according to  the US Toxic \nSubstances Control Act (US TSCA) [ 40 CFR § 798.1100] Test Guideline (TG) .4  The LD 50 in rats was reported to be > 2000 \nmg/kg bw.4  No further details were provided.  \nCaprylyl Methicone  \nIn an acute dermal exposure study, performed in accordance with  Organizatio n for Economic Cooperation and \nDevelopment  (OECD) TG 402, undiluted Capryl yl Methicone  was tested on  5 male and 5 female Wistar rats  at a dose of \n2000 mg/kg bw.6  The test substance was spread over approximately 10%  of the back area, and covered with an occlusive \ndressing for 24 h.  Test sites were rinsed with water at the end of the application period; animals were examined daily for \n14 d, before necropsy.  No mortality or signs of systemic toxicity were observed.  The dermal LD 50 of Caprylyl Methicone \nwas determined to be > 2000 mg/kg bw in rats.  \nDimethicone  \nA single, 2008 mg/kg bw dermal application of Dimethicone ( 332.5 kg/m ⋅s) was made on 5 male and 5 female Sprague \nDawley (SD) rats, in accordance with the OECD  TG 402.3  The test substance was spread over approximately 10% of the \ntotal body surface and was held in place with a bandage for 24 h.  Test sites were rinsed with lukewarm water at the end of \nthe application period; animals were monitore d for mortality and clinical signs for 14 d, before necropsy.  No mortality or  \nnoticeable abnormalities were observed.  The dermal LD 50 in this study was determined to be > 2008 mg/kg bw.  \nUndiluted Dimethicone ( 54,150 kg/m ⋅s) was applied to the shaved backs of 5 male and 5 female adult New Zealand \nWhite rabbits at a dose of 2 000 mg/kg bw.3 The test site was occluded and Dimethicone was in contact with the skin for 24 h.  \nAfter exposure, the residual test material was removed with Dimethicone ( 332.5 kg/m⋅s)-moistened gauze.  The rabbits were \nfrequently observed on the day of tr eatment , and at least once a day during a 14 -d observation period.  No signs of systemic \ntoxicity were observed during the study, and no rabbits died during this study.  Under the conditions of this study, the acut e \nLD 50 of Dimethicone in adult male and female rabbits was considered to be > 2 000 mg/kg bw.  \nOral  \nDimethicone, Methicone, and Vinyl  Dimethicone were not acutely toxic following oral exposure.1   Methicone had an \noral LD 50 of > 64 ml/kg in male albino rats.  Vinyl  Dimethicone had an oral LD 50 of > 16.0 ml/kg in Sprague Dawley  rats.  \nGreasy -textured fur was noted in the rats, while one rat had pneumonia and pleuritis observed at necropsy.      \nCaprylyl Methicone  \nIn accordance with OECD TG 423, 3 female Wistar rats were administered a single dose of 2000 mg/kg bw Caprylyl \nMethicone, via gavage.6  No signs of systemic toxicity were observed over the course of a 14 -d post -dose observation period.  \nAn expected increase in body weight was observed in all animals, none died prior to necropsy, and no gross pathological changes were observed.  The acute oral LD\n50 of Caprylyl Methicone was determined as > 2000 mg/kg bw in female rats.  \nDimethicone  \nFive male and 5 female Sprague -Dawley  rats were administered a single  dose of 2000 m g/kg bw Dimethicone ( 57,000 \nkg/m⋅s) in corn oil by gavage.3  No overt signs of systemic toxicity were observed over the course of a 14- d post -dose observation period.  All of the rats gained weights, no animals died during the study, and no gross necropsy lesions were \nobserved.  The acute oral LD 50 of Dimethicone in male and female rats was determined as > 2 000 mg/kg bw.  \nInhalation  \nTwo dogs, 7 guinea pigs, and 7 rats were exposed to a “200 fluid” aerosol  (which contained an unspecified \nconcentration of  Dimethicone ) at a concentration of 2.12 mg/ l for 6 h.1  Three guinea pigs died during the study, and all \nnecropsied animals had hyperemic lungs with hemorrhagic areas ; however, the researchers concluded that this fluid \nproduced only minimal signs of toxicity and was essentially non- toxic .  Vapor exposur e to Methicone at a concentration of \n0.78 mg/ l for 8h, and to a substance identified as \"vinyl dimethylsiloxy -terminated polydimethylsiloxane ,\" at a near -\nsaturation concentration (no further details provided)  for 6 h,  did not cause mortality or lesions  in rats.  Aerosolized Hexyl \nMethicone  was administered by whole -body inhalation exposure to Fischer F344/N rats (n = 10/group) for 4 h, at target \nconcentrations of 1.0 mg/ l (mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD of 0.27µm), 2.0 mg/l (MMAD of 0.29 µm),and 5.0 \nmg/l (MMAD of 0.2 µm).  Two, four, and all rats exposed to 1.0, 2.0 and 5.0 mg/ l, respectively, died .  Lesions at necropsy of \nthe rats who died included dark red or mottled lungs  and/or fluid filled trachea.  The calculated LC 50 for both sexes was 1.8  \nmg/l.  In the Discussion, the Panel noted that concern for respiratory  exposure to these ingredients in cosmetics was \nmitigated due to the low use concentrations in aerosol formulations and large particle sizes  (primarily in the range of 60 – \n80 µm, with <1% of the particles under 10 µ m). \nDimethicone  \nAn acute aerosol inhalation study of Dimethicone ( 95,000 kg/m⋅s) was performed in a similar fashion to  OECD TG \n403.3  Groups of 5 Wistar rats were exposed  for 4 h , nose -only, to solution s of 25% Dimethicone dissolved in petroleum \nether , or to two other solvents  in separate control  groups (control solvents not named) .  Rats were exposed to mean \nDimethicone concentrations of 4315 mg/m3 (MMAD  of 1.55 µm), or 11,582 mg/m3 (MMAD  of 1.52 µm).  During, and after , \nthe 14-d observation period, no  mortality or clinical symptoms were attributed to Dimethicone exposure.  The LC 50 was \ndetermined to be > 11,582 mg/m3. \nDimethicone ( 9500 kg/m⋅s) dissolved in dichloromethane was used to perform an acute aerosol inhalation toxicity \nstudy, in accordance with OECD TG 403.3  Groups of 5 Wistar rats were tested with concentrations of either 153.3, 322.0, \n445.6, or 694.8 mg/m3 Dimethicone ( MMAD  up to 1.8 µm) .  Duration of exposure was not provided; however, according to \nOECD TG 403, exposure can be up to 6 h (nose -only) in rats.  No mortality or toxic effects were observed during the 14- d \nobservation period or  at necropsy.  The LC 50 was determined to be > 695 mg/m3. \nShort Term Toxicity  Studies  \nDermal  \nNo adverse reactions were found in rabbits following short -term dermal dosing with 6% to 25% Dimethicone.1 Rats \nwere dermally dosed with either 0.04% Dimethicone  (18.92 kg/m ⋅s), or a solution containing 5% each of four linear/cyclic \ndimethylpolysiloxanes for 4 wk.  No macroscopic changes were noted.  Changes were seen in serum total cholesterol \nconcentrations, and dermal dosing resulted in less silicon accumulation in the fat when compared to oral administration.  \nDimethicone  \nThree groups of 10 New Zealand white rabbits (number per sex not specified) were dermally administered Dimethicone \n(332.5 kg/m ⋅s) via an occlusive patch for 4 wk (28 d) at doses of 0, 100, 300, or 1000 mg/kg/d.3  On a daily basis, rabbits \nwere examined for dermal irritation prior to application, and were exposed to the test material for 6 h prior to patch removal.  \nBody weight was measured twice a week, and blood samples were taken for hematology and blood chemistry evaluations on \nday 29 for males and day 30 for females.  No deaths or adverse events related to the treatment occurred.  Body weight, hematology, blood chemistry, and gross and microscopic evaluation of selected organs showed no changes that were considered of toxicological significance.  The no -observ able- adverse -effect -level (NOAEL) for dermal application of \nDimethicone in rabbits in this study was therefore considered to be 1000 mg/kg/d.  \nOral  \nMongrel dogs were fed with up to 3.0 g/kg/d of 83% Dimethicone for 12 wk.\n1  The liver of dosed dogs had bile pigment \ndeposits in  Kupfer and hepatic cells, which were proportional to the daily dose received.  \nCaprylyl Methicone  \nFour  groups of 10 male and 10 female Crl: WI (Han) rats were dosed with 0, 100, 300, or 1000 mg/kg bw/d Caprylyl \nMethicone, in corn oil, by gavage, for 28 d.6  Recovery groups of 5 male and 5 female rats were selected f rom the control and \n1000 mg/kg bw/d group, to be observed for 14 d after exposure.  No mortality or clinical abnormalities occurred during \nobservation .  An elongated mean activated partial thro mboplastin time in the 1000 mg /kg bw/d males  became similar to \ncontrols at the end of the recovery period .  A statistically significant lower red blood cell count  in the 300 mg/kg females, an absent pupillary reflex and white stain on the eye of a 100 mg/kg male,  slight vacuolation in the adrenal glands of 1 male \neach from the 100 mg/kg and 1000 mg/kg  groups , and 2 males from the 1000 mg/kg/d recovery group, and a statistically \nsignificant minimal increase in the liver weights of 300 and 1000 mg/kg females, were all considered unrelated  to treatment  \nor toxicologically irrelevant.  The reported NOAEL of Caprylyl Methicone was determined to be > 1000 mg/kg bw/d.  \nFour  groups of 10 male and 10 female Sprague -Dawley rats were dosed with 0, 500, 1000, or 5000 mg/kg bw/d \nCaprylyl Methicone, via gavage, for 28 d.5  Two females treated with 500 mg/kg bw, 1 male and 2 females treated with 1000 \nmg/ kg bw, and 3 males and 1 female treated with 5000 mg/kg bw died prior to sacrifice. The unscheduled animal deaths \nwere attributed to aspiration of the test substance, and not the test substance itself.  Besides dark, mottled, and congested \nlungs, enlarged livers, and sores, a lopecia, and rough, stained fur in the posterior regions of animals i n the 5000 mg/kg bw \ngroup, no statistically significant differences were observed in the laboratory and clinical findings.  Statistically significant lower mean organ and body weights were only observed in 5000 mg/kg bw males and females; organ to brain weight ratios of the treated groups were not significantly different from controls.    The NOAEL was determined to be 1000 mg/kg bw/d and the no -observed -effect -level (NOEL) was deemed to b e 500 mg/kg bw/d.  \nDimethicone  \nIn a 28- d oral toxicity  study,  Dimethicone (9.5 kg/m⋅s and 332.5 kg/m ⋅s) was administered to groups of 10 CDF -(F344) -\nCrlBr rats in the diet, at concentrations of 10,000 to 100,000 ppm (1 - 10%).3   No mortality or adverse clinical signs of \ntoxicity were noted durin g observation or upon necropsy.   Test article related symptoms consisted of dose- related increase in \nmatting of male and female rat fur, increased incidence of corneal opacity and inflammation, and significantly decreased mean triglycerides and low -density- lipoprotein levels (LDL) at higher doses ( ≥ 2.5%).  These symptoms were not regarded as \nadverse effects  and the NOAEL of Dimethicone in the rat diet was determined to be > 100,000 ppm.  \nInhalation   \nA cat, rabbit, guinea pig, 2 rats, and 4 mice were sprayed for 4 h with an atomizer containing 10 ml /kg of a sample of \nDimethicone  (containing 110 siloxane units; 140 cm\n2/s; dynamic viscosity  or specific gravity values were not available ); the \ntreatment was repeated for a second time , 29 d later.1  Particle size was not available, but the atomizer output was described \nas a thick fog that settled rapidly on the animals and the cage .  After the second tr eatment , no adverse effects were seen in the \ncat, rabbit, guinea pig, and rats  during the 6- wk post -dosing observation period.   All 4 mice died ; one died after the second \ntreatment, and the 3 others during the post -dosing period.  The  researchers stated th ere was a relatively high mortality rate \nin mice in the laboratory at the time, and that  the link between treatment and deaths was uncertain .  Overall, the authors \nconcluded that inhalation of silicone oil is har mless. \nSubchronic Toxicity Studies  \nOral  \nMice and rats were dosed for 90 d with up to 10% Dimethicone , via diet. 1  No signs of systemic toxicity  were seen \nduring the study or during post -study pathologic examination .  Anal leakage of Dimethicone was detected in the high dose \ngroups and in those rats that were fed more viscous Dimethicone.   Observations of slight chronic corneal inflammation, \nopacity, and neovascularization w as observed in the eyes of t he rats, regardless of dosage, and w as regarded as a local \nocular effect resulting from contact with the feed.   In another  rat study, in which animals were fed an antifoam compound \ncontaining 0.1%, 0.3%, or 1.0% Dimethicone for 120 d, changes in body weight or spleen weight were observed  in the 1.0% \nDimethicone dos e group.   \nChronic Toxicity Studies  \nOral  \nNo significant differences were observed in the organ weights of Wistar rats that were fed 0.3% Dimethicone in the diet \nfor 2 yr, compared to controls .1   Upon pathologic examination, pulmonary lesions, changes in the ovaries and uterus, and \nmild fatty changes in the liver and tubular epithelium of the kidneys was observed in all treated rats.  Rats and rabbits whi ch \nwere fed 1% Dimethicone in the diet (50 or 350 cm2/s; dynamic viscosity  or specific gravity values were not available ) for up \nto 1 yr did not exhibit signs of systemic toxicity.  \nDimethicone  \nFour groups of 30 male and 30 fema le Fischer 344 were administered Dimethicone (9.5 kg/m ⋅s) in the diet at doses of 0 \n(control), 100, 300, or 1000 mg/kg bw/d  for 12 mo.3,22  Four groups of 10 males and 10 females from each treatment group \nwere necropsied after 12 mo of Dimethicon e administration.  The remaining animals  (20 male and 20 female rats from each \ngroup ) were observed for chronic recovery for 12 mo  after the 12 -mo treatment period.  Test article -related toxicological \neffects in necropsied rats were limited to increased incidence of ocular opacities in ≥ 300 mg/kg bw/d females and 1000 \nmg/kg bw/d males.  Similarly , in the chronic recovery group, there was an increase in eye opacity for all treated male groups, without dose correlation.  This result was further supported by microscopic findings of keratitis and corneal dystrophy.  The \nNOEL for systemic toxicity of Dimethicone was determined to be equal to the highest tested dose, 1000 mg/kg bw/d.  \nDEVELOPMENTAL AND REPRODUCTIVE TOXICITY (DART) STUDIES  \nDimethicone was tested in  numerous oral -dose (using rats) and dermal -dose (using rats, rabbits, monkeys) reproductive \nand developmental toxicity studies.1  In a n oral study with rats, 3.3 m l/kg/d Dimethicone was administered directly to the \nstomach for 6 d.    Males treated with 1 of 3 Dimethicone samples (no further details provided)  had significantly decreased \nbody weight and/or decreased testes or seminal vesicles weights.  No treatme nt-related adverse findings were noted in \npregnant females or fetuses, dosed orally, via diet, and dermal ly.  In an intergenerational study, a motor oil containing an \nunspecified amount of Dimethicone was applied undiluted in doses of 0.1, 0.4, and 1.5 m l/kg, to the shaved backs of the \nparental (P 1) and first generation (F 1) of Sprague -Dawley rats, daily for an 8 -wk premating period, 3- wk mating period, and \nthroughout gestation and lactation.  No statistically significant differences in mortality or surviva l rates were seen in F 1 rats \non day 0 ( parturition ), however , mortality after parturition was significantly decreased in the 0.4 and 1.5 -ml/kg groups. \nConversely, mortality in the F 2 litter was significantly increased in the 0.4 ml/kg group on day 0.   A bsolute testes weight s \nsignificantly  reduced in the adult F 1 male rats of the 1.5 m l/kg group, beginning wk 7, but the relative testes to body weight \nratio was not significantly different from controls.  \nCaprylyl Methicone  \nFour  groups of 10 male and 10 female Crl: WI (Han) rats were dosed with 0, 100, 300, or 1000 mg/kg bw/d Caprylyl \nMethicone, in corn oil, by gavage, for 28 d ; 5 male and 5 female rats  from the both the control and 1000 mg/kg bw/d groups \nserved as recovery animals .6  The animals were cohoused to facilitate impregnation, after a minimum of 14 d of exposure, for \na maximum time period of 14 d.  Fertility and  conception parameters were not aff ected, and n o maternal abnormalities were \nobserved ; no changes or differences in fetal  or pup body weights, number of live offspring, sex ratios, litter size, and skeletal , \nvisceral , or external malformations  were observed .  The NOAEL for Caprylyl Methicone maternal toxicity and \ndevelopmental effects was determined to be > 1000 mg/kg bw /d. \nGENOTOXICITY STUDIES  \nDimethicone tested negative for genotoxic effects in multiple Ames tests, at up to 5000 µg/plate, bacterial reverse \nmutation assays , at up to  79% in formulation, micronucleus tests, at up to 5 g/kg, and in mouse cell and Chinese hamster \novary (CHO) assays, at up to 10,000 µg/ ml, both with and without metabolic activation.1 \nIn Vitro  \nC30-45 Alkyl Dimethicone  \nA bacterial reverse mutation assay was performed with C30 -45 Alkyl Dimethicone in accordance with OECD TG 471.4  \nThe test substance was found to be non -mutagenic.  (No further details were provided.)  \nCaprylyl Methicone  \nIn accordance with OECD TG 471, Salmonella typhimurium strains TA97s, TA98, TA100, TA102, and TA 1535 were \ntested with up to 5 mg/plate Caprylyl Methicone (in ethanol), in a bacterial reverse mutation assay, in the presence and \nabsence of metabolic activation.6  No precipitates or cytoto xicity w ere observed and the test substance was determined to be \nnon-mutagenic to bacteria, under these study conditions.   \nDimethicone  \nS. typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537, and Escherichia coli strains WP2 uvrA and WP2 uvrA (pKM \n101) were tested with Dimethicone ( 57,000 kg/m ⋅s) in a bacterial reverse mutation assay, in the presence and absence of \nmetabolic activation.3  The assay was performed in two stages, in which a range -finding study, and consequent initial and \nindependent repeat assays were used to evaluate the mutagenic potential of Dimethicone. Based on the toxicity assay, the maximum dose tested was 5000 µg per plate.  Although precipitate was observed at ≥ 500 or at ≥ 1500 µg /plate, no \nappreciable toxicity was observed; Dimethicone was considered non -mutagenic under these study conditions.  \nIn Vivo  \nCaprylyl Methicone  \nGroups of 5 ICR mice were intraperitoneally dosed with 0, 1253, 2505, or 5010 mg/kg bw Caprylyl Methicone, or \ngiven 80 mg/kg bw of cyclophosphamide (positive control) via gavage, in a mammalian erythrocyte micronucleus test.5,6  \nBone marrow cells were harvested 24, 48, and 72 h after dose exposure.  No significant increase in the micronucleated \npolychromatic erythroc ytes (PCEs) was observed in any of the test animals at all harvest times.  Caprylyl Methicone was  \ndeemed non - genotoxic  under the conditions of this study.  CARCINOGENICITY STUDIES  \nDimethicone was negative for carcinogenicity in both an oral (up to 2.5% Dimethicone in diet for 76 wk ) and a dermal \ncarcinogenicity study ( lifetime application ; 50 µl of the test article  (motor oil ) that contained an unspecified amount of \nDimethicone ) using mice.1  One treated mouse in the dermal study had a palpable skin mass at the application site during wk \n65, which regressed by wk 67; n o application site dermal neoplasms were microscopically confirmed in either treated or \ncontrol mice.   \nDimethicone  \nThe carcinogenic potential of a silicone resin containing 92%  Dimethicone  and 8% silica (300- 1050 cm2/s; dynamic \nviscosity  or specific gravi ty values were not provided; similar to “Simethicone,” a cosmetic ingredient, which is sold over -\nthe-counter as an anti -flatulence medication, with out significant adverse effects23) was evaluated using groups of 50 male and \n50 female F344/DuCrj rats.24  The rats were given diets containing 0, 1.25, or 5.0% of the test article for 104 wk.  Animals \nwere monitored twice daily for signs of toxicity, and body weight was measured alternate weeks.  During the study, there \nwere no significant differences in appearance or behavior between the control and treatment groups.  Survival rates were also not significantly different between both groups.  The relative organ weight percentage for livers in male rats that received 5.0% test article in the diet were significantly lower than those of the livers in male control rats.  Lower relative kidney, brain, and heart organ weight percentages were also considered to be statistically significant in treated female rat s compared \nto female control rats.  There was a statistically significant, 2 - 18%, increase in the incidence of parafollicular cell (C -cell) \nadenomas in female rats within the highest dose group (5.0%); however, according to previous carcinogenic assays done by the National Toxicology Program, the naturally oc curring incidence of C -cell adenomas ranges from 0  - 34%, as seen in \ncontrol rats .  The male s of the 5.0% dose group experienced a decreased incidence of prostate cancer (8% vs. 22% in \ncontrols); however, values for prostatic intraepithelial neoplasias (PI Ns) were similar across groups.  The prostate cancer \nincidence of the control group was relatively high (compared to historical results elsewhere); thus, the difference between treatment and control groups were considered incidental.  \nIn a long -term toxicit y study, 3 groups of 20 male and 20 female F344 rats were observed for oncogenic effects \nassociated with  oral administration of Dimethicone ( 9.5 kg/m⋅s) at doses of 100, 300, or 1000 mg/kg bw/d for up to 24 mo.\n22  \nSlightly increased incidence of corneal opacity was observed in male rats dosed at 1000 mg/kg bw/d and in female rats dosed at 100 and 1000 mg/kg bw/day, as well as an overall increase in minimal to mild keratitis in all male a nd female rats \n(statistical significance not mentioned).  A statistically significant increase in the incidence of islet cell adenomas was \nobserved in the 100 mg/kg bw male dose group; however, the lack of an effect in female groups, and high incidence of islet \ncell adenomas in controls (even when assigned to recover for 12 mo ), suggested that that these effects were independent of \nDimethicone exposure.  No neoplastic changes were observed and the NOEL for oncogenicity of Dimethicone was determined to be 1000 mg/kg bw/d.  \nOTHER RELEVANT STUDIES \nImmunotoxicity  \nDimethicone   \nFour groups of 20 female A.SW ( H-2s-T18b-/SnJ) mice received a single 0.5 -ml intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection  of one of \nthe following: phosphate -buffered saline (PBS) as the negative control, pristane (2,6,10,14 -tetramethylpentadecane) as the \npositive control, silicone gel (taken from a mammary implant), or Dimethicone  (970 kg/m ⋅s).25  A pretest bleed was taken via \norbital puncture prior to injection, af ter which blood samples were obtained post -injection once a month for 6 mo . The mice \nwere killed after 6 mo of observation, and peritoneal macrophages were collected by lavage.  Additionally, immuno -\nprecipitation, fluorescent antinuclear antibody (FANA) microscopy, macrophage culture, kidney pathology, and enzyme -\nlinked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) immunoglobin analyses were performed.  Although Dimethicone -treated mice did not \nproduce lupus -associated antinuclear antibodies (observed only in positive  contro ls) various antibody isotopes were observed \nwithin 2 mo of injection.  Immunoglobulin M (IgM) levels remained elevated compared to controls, and IgG1 and IgE serum \nlevels were significantly elevated at 4 mo in comparison to 5 - 6 mo for the controls.  Macr ophages from negative control \nmice secreted little i nterleukin -6 (IL -6), a pro -inflammatory cytokine, while pristane -, silicone gel -, and Dimethicone -treated \nmice spontaneously secreted IL- 6 and also produced greater, dose -dependent amounts of IL -6 when cultured with \nlipopolysaccharide.  Suspected silicone droplets and expanded vacuoles within the glomeruli of treated mice kidneys also indicated capacity for systemic accumulation.   DERMAL IRRITATION AN D SENSITIZATION  STUDIES  \nIrritation  \nMost dermal irritation studies using rabbits classified Dimethicone as a minimal irritant.1  Studies that scored reactions \naccording to the Draize scale reported primary irritation indices  of ≤ 2.8(with test samples containing 5% to 100% \nDimethicone).   Vinyl D imethicone was not irritating to rabbits following a 4- h exposure.  \nAnimal  \nC30-45 Alkyl Dimethicone  \nA skin irritation test using C30 -45 Alkyl Dimethicone was  performed in rabbits , in accordance with US TSCA [ 40 CFR \n§ 798.4470].4  The test substance was determined to be non -irritating.  (No further details were provided).  \nCaprylyl Methicone  \nIn a skin irritation test, performed in accordance with OECD TG 404, 0.5 ml Caprylyl Methicone was ap plied  neat for  \n4 h under semi -occlusion to a 25 cm2 patch of closely shaven  skin of 3 female New Zealand white rabbits .6  After patch \nremoval, the  exposure sites were washed with water and  scored using the Draize scale for up to 72 h.  No signs of irritation \nwere observed in any of the  animals , and the test substance was deemed non -irritating.  \nIn a dermal toxicity study, also performed in accordance with OECD TG 404, 3 male and 3  female New Zealand white \nrabbits were exposed to an occlusive application of 97%, undiluted Caprylyl Methicone  (dose  not specified) .5   No deaths or \nclinical signs were noted during the study period.  Minor erythema was observed in 4 rabbi ts within 1 h following the contact \nperiod, but had subsided within 24 h in 3 of the 4 animals and 48 h for the last animal.  Minor edema was apparent in 1 \nanimal within 1 h, but subsided by 24 h.  Desquamation developed in 1 rabbit after 7 d of testing; n o other signs of irritation \nwere observed, and the test substance was deemed slightly irritating to the skin.  \nDimethicon e \nThree rabbits and 3 guinea pigs were exposed to non -occlusive, daily application s of 0.5 ml  of Dimethicone (100 cm2/s; \ndynamic viscosity  or specific gravity values were not provided) to a 2.5 cm2 patch of closely shaven skin for 10 d .26  No \nerythema or signs of skin irritation or in flammation were  noted in the animals.   \nIn an acute dermal toxicity study, undiluted, Dimethicone (57,000 kg/m ⋅s) was applied to the shaved backs of 5 male \nand 5 female adult New Zealand White rabbits, under occlusion, for 24 h, at a dose of 2000 m g/kg bw.3  Erythema was \nobserved at the application site in all 10 rabbits, but resolved by the 7th day of observation.  \nSensitization  \nDimethicone (tested undiluted and at 79%) was not a sensitizer in 4 assays using mice and guinea pigs.1  It was not a \nsensitizer at 5.0% in a clinical H RIPT using 83 subjects .   \nAnimal  \nCaprylyl Methicone  \nThe sensitization potential of Caprylyl Methicone was eva luated with a Buehler test, according to OECD TG 406.6  \nDuring induction, 20 male guinea pigs were patched with 100% Caprylyl Methicone (in acetone) once a week, via 6- h \nocclusive patches , for 3 wk.  After a 2 -wk rest period, a one -time, c hallenge application of  0.75% Caprylyl Methicone (in \nacetone)  held in place by an occlusive dressing for a 6 -h exposure period was made .  Two groups of 10 guinea pigs served as \nthe negative and positive control group s.  The test article was not a sensitizer.  \nIn a guinea pig maximization test (number of animals not specified) , intradermal injections of Freund’s Complete \nAdjuvant/saline (1:1), with and without 5% Caprylyl Methicone, did not cause ulceration of the injection sites and was well -\ntolerated.5  During topical induction, administration  sites trea ted only with  5% Caprylyl Methicone (vehicle not provided)  \nshowed minor dermal irritation ; however , sites treated with 5% Caprylyl Methicone in mineral oil did not show signs of \nirritation.   Challenge applications were made with 5% Caprylyl Methicone in m ineral oil, and were observed at 24 and 48 h \nafter patch removal (occlusion not specified).  No dermal reactions were seen in either the test or control groups  at 48  h, and \nthe test substance was deemed a non -sensitizer.    \nDimethicone  \nFive groups of 8 female B6C3F1 mice were tested for contact hypersensitivity to Dimethicone.27  Dimethicone was \ndetermined to be a non -irritant during a primary dermal irritancy study, and was applied undiluted during both the induction \nand challenge phases.  Eight , 20 µl induction applications , of either saline (challenged with saline) , saline (challenged with \nDimethicone), or Dimethicone  (challenged with Dimethicone) were made for 8 consecutive days , while 5 applications of \nacetone/olive oil (challenged with 0.5% 1- fluoro -2,4-dinitrobenzene  (DNFB)), or 0.5% D NFB in acetone + olive oil (4+1) \n(challenged with 0.5% DNFB ), were made to a 0.5 cm2 shaved and debr ided region of the upper back.   After a 6- d rest  period, mice were injected with 20 µl of 125- iododeoxyuridine to measure the potential for Dimethicone to elicit a response \nvia radioisotopic methods .  Challenge applications were made 7 d after the rest period to the left ear using a cotton swab , and  \nmice were examined for contact hypersensitivity via the mouse ear swelling test (MEST) for 2 d.  All mice, except for 8 \ntreated with Dimethicone, were killed after the first MEST; the untreated and challenged ears were biopsied and counted in a \ngamma counter.  After 7 d, the surviving mice, and an additional 8 mice were tested in a second MEST.  No statistically \nsignificant hypersensitivity was observed in the mice sensitized with Dimethicone, from the radioisotopic or MEST \nmeasurements.  Subsequent challenge of previously sensitized mice also did not produce any change in the occurrence of ear swelling , and the test substance was determined a non -sensitizer.  \nHuman  \nDimethicone  \nIn a human repeat ed insult patch test (HRIPT), Dimethicone ( 11,875 kg/m ⋅s) was tested neat as a negative control , and \nwas used as a vehicle for a 5% (v/v) solution of an unspecified test substance.3  Sodium lauryl sulfate (0.1% aqueous \nsolution) was used as a positive control.  Of the 1 15 subjects enrolled, 106 completed the study; no subjects withdrew due to \nadverse reactions to the test substance.  Induction consisted of 9 consecutive applications, where 0.2 ml  of Dimethicone  was \napplied under a semi -occlusive dressing for 24 h.  The test sites were evaluated in the following 48 - 72 h.  After the 9th \napplication, there was a 10 to 15 -d non -treatment period.  Challenge occurred in the sixth week of the study ; the substance \nwas applied to an unexposed site for 24 h , and graded after 24 - 48 h.  No evidence of sensitization to Dimethicone, as a \ncontrol  or vehicle, was observed.  \nOCULAR IRRITATION STUDIES  \nMost ocular irritation studies using rabbits classified Dimethicone, ranging in concentration from 10% to 35%,  as a \nmild to minimal irritant.1  The most common finding was a conjunctival reaction.  However, i nstillation of 0.005 ml 15% \nDimethicone produced minor to moderate conjunctival irritation in all 6 rabbits; the irritation cleared in 5 of the 6 rabbits \nwithin 72 h.   Additionally , a few studies reported conjunctival reactions , chemosis, and persisting redness, especially when \nthe e yes were unrinsed .  Similar to Dimethicone, Methicone and Vinyl  Dimethicone also produced conjunctival reactions.  \nC30-45 Alkyl Dimethicone  \nThe ocular irritancy potential of  C30-45 Alkyl Dimethicone was tested  in rabbits , in accordance to US TSCA [ 40 CFR § \n798.4500 ].4  Slight conjunctiva l effects were observed, but resolved within 24 h of exposure.   The test substance was \ndetermined to  be non- irritating.  (No further details were provided).  \nCaprylyl Methicone  \nIn an ocular irritation study, performed in accordance with OECD TG 405, 3 female New Zealand white rabbits were \ntreated with 0.1 ml Caprylyl Methicone in one eye for 24 h  (the second eye serving as control) .6  The treated eyes were \nthoroughly washed with saline after 24 h, and were examined at 1, 24, 48, and 72 h post -application.  A 0.01% fluorescein-\nsodium solution was used to examine the treated eyes for corneal lesions at 24 and 72 h.  Dilated b lood vessels were observed \nin 2 of the 3 animals, as well as colorless eye discharge with moistening of the lids 1 h after instillation.  All signs of irritation \ndisappeared within 24 h of treatment , and the test substance was deemed not irritating to the eye.  \nIn a similar  study, also performed  in accordance with OECD TG 405  (dose not specified) , 3 male and 3 female New \nZealand white rabbits did not exhibit corneal injury or iritis.5  Minor conjunctival redness  and minor (in 5 animals) to \nmoderate (in 1 animal) ocular discharge occurred in all rabbits .  Ocular irritation subsided within 24 h in 5 animals, and  48 h \nin the last animal.  The test substance was deemed slightly irritating to the eye.  \nDimethicone  \nSixteen adult pigmented rabbits were tested for corneal tolerance of Dimethicone.28  One eye of each animal was treated \n(the other eye served as a control) by forming a hanging suture in the lid which allowed 0.7 - 1.0 ml of  generically produced, \nas well as medical -grade, Dimethicone at varying viscosities ( 485 - 12,125 kg/m ⋅s) to remain on the eye for 3  - 6 h.  Medical -\ngrade Dimethicone ( 970 kg/m ⋅s), which is produced with higher manufacturing, biocompatibility, and safety standards for \nuse in pharmaceuticals and medical devices, was included to assess if it would elicit a variable eye irritation respons e.  The \noil was only replaced if the eye cup leaked or if the animal moved.  The eyes were examined with fluorescein by slit lamp immediately after treatment, and were either enucleated immediately or 3 - 7 d later.  Compared to the control eye, which was \ntreated with a balanced saline solution, the eyes treated with Dimethicone exhibited increased epithelial and whole corneal \nthickness, which persisted for several days and was most noticeable ≥ 3 d post -treatment.  Although there appeared to be \nbetter ocular tolerance for the medical -grade Dimethicone, it also caused some corneal changes; under light microscopy, all \neyes treated with Dimethicone showed various degrees of intracellular epithelial and stromal edema.  The authors concluded that both non -medical grade and medical -grade Dimethicone are mildly irritating to the corneal epithelium.   The ocular irritancy of Dimethicone was evaluated in a study using groups of 3 guinea pigs or 3 rabbits , to test 5 \nseparately -manufactured samples of Dimethicone (100 cm2/s; dynamic viscosity  or specific gravity values unavailable ).26  \nFor the test, a drop of Dimethicone was instilled once daily for 10 d into the lower eyelid of the animals, and conjunctival \nirritancy and reflex respon se to light and touch were observed for 15 d. The first sample did not produce inflammation or \nocular opacity; however, all tested guinea pigs died by day 8 - 10.  The second sample caused inflammation in the eye of one \nrabbit after 10 d, while 2 guinea pi gs and 1 rabbit died.  The eyes of animals treated with the second sample were also \nopaque.  No adverse effects were observed in the eyes of the rabbits or guinea pigs treated with 3 remaining samples; the \nresearchers opined that the ocular irritancy and i nflammatory effects of silicone fluids may be dependent upon the acidity of \nthe samples . \nMUCOUS MEMBRANE IRRI TATION STUDIES  \nA mucoadhesive paste (53% Dimethicone) was introduced (0.5 g) via syringe into the vaginal cavity of 6 albino \nrabbits.1  Two control rabbits were dosed with a sodium chloride solution.  Tissue was scored according to the Draize scale \n(maximum score of 8) at 24, 48, and 72 h post dosing.  Erythema was noted in 3 rabbits at 24 h, and in one rabbit at 48 h \nafter treatment.  None had erythema at 72 h.  No edema or signs of toxicity were observed.  The irritation score for the paste \nwas 0.22. \nDimethicone  \nFive samples of Dimethicone (100 cm2/s; dynamic viscosity or specific gravity values unavailable ), each not requiring \nmore than 0.1 m l of 0.05 N alcoholic KOH  to neutralize 15 g of the fluid,  were tested for irritation of vaginal mucosa.26  A \nsample of 0.05 ml of Dimethicone was instilled into the vagina of rats  (number of animals not specified)  daily for 8 d, the \nvaginal mucous membrane wa s observed to determine irritancy, and the effect on leukocyte count was determined.  A 77.8 - \n88% increase in leukocytes was observed in the vaginal smears of rats treated with two samples of Dimethicone.  A similar \nincrease was observed for rats instilled with formaldehyde as the reference irritant.   Leukocyte increases in the rats treated \nwith the 3 remaining samples was markedly lower.  The authors concluded that 2 of the silicone samples with a higher acid ity \n(0.17) and acid value of 0.3 were more likely to be mucous membrane irritants  than the  other  3 samples , in which the \nincrease of leukocytes was relatively low  (0.05 - 0.10 acidity; acid values  were  not provided) .  \nCLINICAL STUDIES  \nCase Reports  \nDimethicone  \nA 23 -d old, premature twin male infant suffering with nasal congestion was accidentally sprayed intranasally with \ndiaper rash protectant spray (instead of nasal saline spray), which listed 10% Dimethicone as the only active ingredient.29  \nThe child went into a choking and coughing spell, and was rushed to the emergency department.  After 2 h, he was still in \nrespiratory distress, wherein his oxygen saturation had dropped to 85% and his chest x- ray showed diffuse bilateral \ninfiltrates, suggestive of bilateral chemical pneumonitis.  By the 3rd day, he developed an eosinophilia of 31 - 37%, with an \nabsolute eosinophilic count of 3100 - 4250 per µl.  He was treated with frequent saline bronchial lavages and chest physical \ntherapy to remove mucus plugs blocking his endotracheal tube and was weaned off the ventilator by the 7th day after \nexposure.  Referring to the Exp ert Panel  evaluation that Dimethicone is safe for cosmetic use and when inhaled short term,1 \nthe researchers were of the opinion that Dimethicone did not cause the patient’s symptoms.  They found that the inactive \ningredients of the product were aloe oil extract, caprylic/capric triglyceride, mineral oil, Peruvian balsam oil, shea liquid , and \ntocopher yl acetate/ vitamin  E.  The authors concluded that the massive dose of mineral oil exposure was the most likely cause \nfor acute pneumonitis, as was the Peruvian balsam oil for eosinophilia . \nSUMMARY  \nAccording to the Dictionary , the majority of the se 30 methicone ingredients are reported to function in cosmetics as \nskin conditioning agents  and/or  hair conditioning agents .  Of the ingredients in this report, Dimethicone and Methicone have \nthe greatest frequency of use, according to 2022 VCRP data.  R eported use for Dimethicone increased from use in 1659 \nformulations in 1998 to 7747 in 2022 , and reported frequency of use of Methicone increased from no reported uses in 1998 to \nuse in 678 formulations in 2022.   The highest concentration of use reported in 2019 was for Dimethicone , at a concentration \nof 85% in moisturizing products; the maximum concentration of use reported previously for Dimethicone was 80% .  \nMaximum use concentrations for Dimethicone increased  for several product categories, including those resulting in dermal \ncontact (30% to 85%), exposure near the eye area (13% to 37.8%), incidental ingestion (20% to 71.3%), incidental inhalation from sprays (16% to 85%), and incidental inhalation from powders (30% to 53%).  \nPenetration  of Dimethicone (9.5 kg/m ⋅s and 332.5 kg/m⋅s) in human abdominal  skin and vaginal tissue was examined \nafter a 96-h application .  A low penetration  rate was observed for both viscosities, with more rapid penetration  in vaginal \ntissue.  In a dermal penetration study, the interaction of Dimethicone with the stratum corneu m lipid microstructure in healthy excised human tissue was evaluated.  All results indicated that Dimethicone did not disturb or interact with the upper layer of \nepidermis, and is not likely to penetrate the skin barrier.   Male rats were exposed to both oc clusive and non -occlusive patches \nof [14C]Dimethicone  to observe dermal absorption and excretion over 3 days .  Radioactivity tracing demonstrated that 70% of \nthe applied dose  remained on the patches, 11.4% of the applied dose was at the site of application , and minimal amounts were \nfound in feces and carbon dioxide traps.   According to an estimated  blood: air partition coefficient of 1.7 x 10-4:1 for human \ninhalation, systemic circulation of Caprylyl Methicone is  not likely.  The  algorithm -based soluble fraction of Caprylyl \nMethicone in the blood  (<< 1% ) suggests the minimal likelihood of excretion in urine as water -soluble metabolites.  \nThe acute dermal LD 50 of C30- 45 Alkyl Dimethicone was determined to be >  2000 mg/kg bw in rats.  In two separat e \nacute dermal studies, u ndiluted  Caprylyl Methicone and Dimethicone ( 54,150 kg/m ⋅s) were applied, under occlusion, to the \nshaved backs of 10 Wistar rats and 10 New Zealand white rabbits , respectively,  at dose s of 2000 mg/kg bw for 24 h.   No \nmortality and  signs of toxicity were observed in either study  and the acute dermal LD 50 for each ingredient was determined to \nbe > 2 000 mg/kg bw  in rats and rabbits , respectively .  A single, 2008 mg/kg bw dermal application of Dimethicone did not \ncause mortality or noticeable abnormalities in 5 male and 5 female Sprague -Dawley rats; under these study conditions  the \nacute dermal LD 50 was determined to be >  2008 mg/kg bw.  Three groups of 10 New Zealand white rabbits were exposed to \nan occlus ive patch of Dimethicone  (332.5 kg/m ⋅s) for 28 d at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/d.  No deaths or adverse events related \nto the exposure occurred, and the NOAEL for dermal application in rabbits was determined to be 1000 mg/kg/d.  \n Three female Wistar rats were administered a single dose of 2000 mg/kg bw Capryl Methicone, via gavage; no \nmortality or signs of systemic toxicity were observed, and the acute LD 50 was determined to be > 2000 mg/kg bw.  Five male \nand female Sprague -Dawley  rats were administered a single  oral dose of 2000 mg/kg bw  Dimethicone  in corn oil.  No toxic \neffects or gross necropsy lesions were observed, and the acute LD 50 was determined to be > 2000 mg/kg bw in rats.  Caprylyl \nMethicone was administered in corn oil, via gavage, at doses of 0, 10 0, 300, or 1000 mg/kg bw/d to groups of 10 male and  10 \nfemale Han rats for 28 d.  No mortality or clinical abnormalities occurred during observation; statistically significant lower \nblood cell count in the 300 mg/kg females, slight vacuolation in the adrenal glands of  males in the  main study, and recovery \ngroup,  dosed with 1000 mg/kg/d, and minimal increases of the liver weights of females in the 300 and 1000 mg/kg groups, \nwere all considered toxicologically irrelevant.  The NOAEL of Caprylyl Methicone was determined to be > 1000 mg/kg \nbw/d.  In another 28 -d oral toxicity study of Caprylyl Methicone, groups of 10 male and 10 female Sprague -Dawley rats were \norally dosed with 0, 500, 1000, or 5000 mg/kg bw/d, via gavage.   Deaths of 2 females in the 500 mg /kg group, 1 male and 2 \nfemales in the 1000 mg/kg group, and 3 males and 1 female in the 5000 mg/kg group were attributed to aspiration of the test \nsubstance.  Congested lungs, enlarged livers, and lower mean organ and body weights in the 5000 mg/kg group were \nstatistically significant, and the NOAEL was determined to be 1000 mg/kg bw/d, while the NOEL was determined to be 500 \nmg/kg bw/d.   In a 28 -d oral toxicity study, Dimethicone was administered at up to 10% (100,000 ppm) in the diet of CDF -\n(F344) -CrlBr rats.  Test article related symptoms included matted fur, increased incidence of corneal opacity, and \nsignificantly decreased mean triglycerides and LDL levels at higher doses.  These symp toms were not considered adverse \neffects and the NOAEL of Dimethicon e was determined > 100,000 ppm.  Four groups of 30 male and 30 female Fischer 344 \nrats were orally administered Dimethicone ( 9.5 kg/m⋅s), in their diet,  at doses up to 1000 mg/kg bw/d for 12 mo .  Amongst \nthe treated rats, four groups of 10 male and 10 fema le rats were necropsied after 12 mo , while  a remaining  20 male and 20 \nfemale rats per group were observed for recovery for 12 mo after the treatment period.  In both necropsied and recovery \ngroups there was an increase in ocular opacity, and the NOEL for s ystemic toxicity was determined to be 1000 mg/kg bw/d.    \nGroups of 5 Wistar rats were exposed for 4 h, nose -only, to solutions of 25% Dimethicone  (95,000 kg/m ⋅s) dissolved in \npetroleum ether, or to two other solvent s in separate control  group s (control solvents not named) .  No mortality or clinical \nsymptoms were attributed to Dimethicone exposure, and the LC 50 was determined to be > 11,582 mg/m3.  Dimethicone ( 9500 \nkg/m⋅s) dissolved in dichloromethane was tested for acute inhalation toxicity, a t concentrations  up to 694.8 mg/m3, in Wistar \nrats.  No mortality or toxic effects were observed, and the LC 50 was determined to be > 695 mg/m3. \nIn a reproductive and developmental toxicity study, 4  groups of 10 male and 10 female Han rats were orally dosed with \n0, 100, 300, or 1000 mg/kg bw/d Caprylyl Methicone, in corn oil, via gavage for 28 d.  Fertility, maternal, birth, and fetal \noutcomes were not adversely affected; the NOAEL for Caprylyl Methicone was determined to be > 1000 mg/kg bw/d.  \nBacterial rev erse mutation assay s were performed with C30- 45 Alkyl Dimethicone  and Caprylyl Methicone ; the test \nsubstance s were non-mutagenic.  In a bacterial reverse mutation assay, S. typhimurium  tester strains TA98, TA100, TA153, \nTA1537, and E. coli strains WP2 uvrA and WP2 uvrA (pKM 101) were tested with Dimethicone  (57,000 kg/m ⋅s), at a \nmaximum dose of 5000 µ g per plate, in the presence and absence of metabolic activation.  Although precipitate was observed \nat ≥ 500 or ≥  1500 µg per plate, Dimethicone was considered non -mutagenic under these study conditions.   In vivo, Caprylyl \nMethicone was intravenously administered at up to 5010 mg/kg bw to groups of 5 ICR mice in a micronucleus test; no \nsignificant increases in PCEs were observed and the test su bstance was deemed non -genotoxic.  \nThe carcinogenic potential of a silicone resin containing Dimethicone and silica  was evaluated by feeding  50 male and \n50 female  F344/DuCrj  rats diets containing up to 5.0% of the test article for 104 wk.  There was a statistically significant, 2  - \n18% increase in the incidence of C -cell adenomas in female rats in the highest dose group, while the male rats in the highest dose group experienced a decreased incidence of prostate cancer  compared to the control group.  The inci dence of prostate \ncancer in the control group was relatively high, and thus the difference between treatment and control groups was considered \nincidental.  \nThree groups of 20 male and 20 female F344 rats were observed for oncogenic effects upon oral  adminis tration of \nDimethicone (10 cm2/s; dynamic viscosity or specific gravity unavailable ) at doses of 100, 300, or 1000 mg/kg bw/d for up to \n24 mo.  Slightly increased incidence of corneal opacity was observed at the maximum dose, as well as a statistically \nsignificant increase in islet adenomas among males in the 100 mg/kg bw group.  However, the lack of increased islet adenomas in female rats and the high incidence amongst control rats suggested that these effects were independent of Dimethicone exposure.  The NOEL for oncogenicity of Dimethicone was determined to be 1000 mg/kg bw/d.  \nTwenty female A.SW mice received a single 0.5 -ml i.p. injection o f Dimethicone, while 3 groups of 20 mice were \ninjected with either saline, prist ane or silicone gel, to evaluate immunological reactions over 6 mo .  Dimethicone -treated mice \nproduced various antibody isotopes within 2 mo of injection, spontaneously secreted and produced greater, dose -dependent \namounts of IL -6, and showed silicone droplets and expanded vacuoles within kidney glomeruli , indicating the possibility  for \nsystemic accumulation.  \nA skin irritation test using C30 -45 Alkyl Dimethicone (test concentrat ion not specified) was performed in rabbits; the \ntest substance was determined to be non -irritating .  Two studies evaluating the dermal irritation potential of a neat, 4 -h, \nocclusive application of Caprylyl Methicone to New Zealand white rabbits were perfo rmed; the test substance was deemed \nnon-irritating  at a dose of 0.5 ml, while it was deemed slightly irritating at an unspecified dose of 97%, undiluted Caprylyl \nMethicone.  Dimethicone did not cause dermal irritation or inflammation in rabbits and guinea  pigs.  Caprylyl Methicone was \ndetermined to be a non -sensitizer in guinea pigs.  Dimethicone did not cause sensitization or irritation in a contact \nsensitization study of female mice.  In an HRIPT, Dimethicone was tested neat (as a negative contro l), and as used as a \nvehicle for a 5% solution of an unspecified test substance, in 106 subjects.  No evidence of sensitization to Dimethicone, as a \ncontrol or vehicle, was observed.  \nThe ocular irritancy potential of C30 -45 Alkyl Dimethicone was tested in rabbits; slight conjunctivae were observed, \nbut resolved in within 24 h of exposure, and the test substance was deemed non- irritating.   Caprylyl Methicone (0.1 ml) was \nnot deemed irritating to rabbit eyes; an unspecified dose of Caprylyl Methicone was considered s lightly irritating to rabbit \neyes in another study.  Sixteen rabbits were exposed for to up to 6 h with 0.7 - 1.0 ml of generic or medical -grade  \nDimethicone , in one eye, to test for variance in ocular irritancy.  All eyes treated with either generic or med ical-grade \nDimethicone evidenced mild irritat ion of the  corneal epithelium.  In a study using groups  of 3 guinea pigs, or  rabbits, 5 \nseparately manufactured samples of Dimethicone ( 100 cm\n2/s; dynamic viscosity  or specific gravity values unavailable ) were \ninstilled into the lower eyelid of the animals once daily for 10 d.  All guinea pigs exposed to the first sample died by day s 8 - \n10, and the second sample caused corneal inflammation in one rabbit after 10 d, and death in another rabbit and 2 guinea pigs.   No adverse effects were observed with exposure to the 3 remaining samples.  Both Dimethicone samples with positive \nresults  had a slightly more acidic profile, suggesting that the ocular irritancy and inflammatory effects of silicone fluids may \nbe acidity -dependent . \nThe potential for Dimethicone ( 0.5 ml; 100 cm\n2/s; dynamic viscosity  or specific gravity values unavailable ) to cause \nvaginal mucosa irritation was tested in rats for 8 d.  An ~88% increase in leukocytes was observed in the vaginal smears of rats treated with two Dimethicone samples.   A similar increase was observed in rats treated with formaldehyde.   The  increase \nin leukocyte s in the rats treated with the 3 remaining Dimethicone samples was markedly lower.  Irritation outcomes for each \nDimeth icone sample were deemed to be affected by higher acidity and acid values . \nA 23 -d old, premature , twin male infant experienced severe respiratory distress, acute pneumonitis, and eosinophilia as \na result of intranasal exposure to a 10% Dimethicone spray .  Although Dimethicone was listed as the active ingredient, \nmineral oil and Peruvian balsam oil were considered to be  causative agents for the severe reaction.  \nDISCUSSION  \nIn accordance with the CIR P rocedures  & Support to the Expert Panel for Cosmetic Ingre dient Safety , the Panel  \nevaluates the conclusions of previously- issued reports approximately every 15 years.  After considering the  dramatic \nincreases in frequency of use  of the previously -reviewed ingredients , as well as  the concentrations of use  in produ cts that \ncould result in incidental inhalatio n for additional Dimethicone, Methicone, and substituted -methicone polymers , the Panel \nreopened  this safety assessment.  T he Panel concluded that the available data are sufficient for determining the safety of these \ningredients  as reportedly used in cosmetics  when formulated to be non -irritating, with the exception that the available data are \ninsufficient to make a determination of safety for  use of these ingredients in cosmetics that  are applied with airbrush d evices.  \nThe Panel was concerned that the potential exists for dermal irritation with the use of products formulated using \ndimethicone, methicone, and substituted -methicone polymers.  The Panel specified that products containing these ingredients \nshould be  formulated to be non -irritating.   Additionally, the  Panel noted that Dimethicone is now being used at, or above, \nconcentrations at which ocular irritation was observed in studies cited in the original assessment.  Subsequently, the Panel distinguished the  difference between instilling 35% Dimethicone in the eye, as described in an animal ocular irritation study \nfrom the original report, compared to using a cosmetic product containing 37.8% Dimethicone, in which ocular contact is not \nintended.  However, the  Panel stated that manufacturers should be cognizant of incidental/accidental exposure to the eye, and \nspecified that products containing the ingredients included in this report should be formulated to be non -irritating  to the eye.  \nAdditionally, the Panel  discussed the validity of results from an ocular irritation study included in the present assessment, in \nwhich test animals died following instillation of 100% Dimethicone (970 kg/m ⋅s) in the eye for 10 d.  The Panel remarked \nthat mortality occurring duri ng an ocular irritation study is very unusual, and toxicologically implausible.   \nThe Panel consider ed the available physico /chemical properties data on  the size distribution of  airborne particles \nproduced by sprays and powders during the use of cosmetics  that may result in incidental inhalation.   The  Panel noted that  \nfinal particle size distribution of a spray product is determined by the composition of the  final formula tion, the concentration \nof individual ingredients , and other relevant spray parameters (e.g., spray nozzle, can size, and propellant type and pressure).   \nAdditionally, the Panel  noted that particle characteristics , such as size, morphology, and surface chemistry , are unique to each \nformulation that has the potential for  incidental inhalation , and these characteristics can affect the associated deposition in the \nrespiratory tract .  Based on the particle size distribution for sprays and powders presented in the Panel’s respiratory exposure \nresource document ( available at https://www.cir -safety.org/cir -findings ), the maximum concentration s of use reported for \nspray and powder use s, and the absence of inhalation toxicity, the Panel concluded on the safety of these ingredi ents as used \nin spray and powder formulations .   \nHowever, the Panel determined that the available data are insufficient to make a determination of safety for use of these \ningredients in products that may be incidentally inhaled when applied using airbrush devices.  The Panel’s respiratory \nexposure resource document ( as link ed above ) describes  the lack of data on potential inhalation exposures resulting from the \nuse of cosmetics  delivered by airbrush technologies . Such uses are  often associated with prolonge d inhalation exposure to \nmicro - to nanosized particles , which may pose a potential risk to public health .  \nCONCLUSION  \nThe Expert Panel for Cosmetic Ingredient Safety concluded that the following 30 dimethicone, methicone, and \nsubstituted -methicone polymers are safe in cosmetics in the present practices of use and concentration described in this safety \nassessment when form ulated to be non -irritating, with the exception that the available data are insufficient to make a \ndetermination of safety for use of these ingredients in products that may be incidentally inhaled  when  applied using airbrush \ndevices.  \n \nAmino Bispropyl Dimethicone  \nAminopropyl Dimethicone  \nAmodimethicone  \nAmodimethicone Hydroxystearate*  \nBehenoxy Dimethicone  \nC20-24 Alkyl Dimethicone  \nC20-24 Alkyl Methicone * \nC24-28 Alkyl Dimethicone * \nC24-28 Alkyl Methicone  \nC26-28 Alkyl Dimethicone  \nC26-28 Alkyl Methicone * \nC30-45 Alkyl Dimethicone  \nC30-45 Alkyl Methicone  \nC30-60 Alkyl Dimethicone * \nC32 Alkyl Dimethicone * Capryl Dimethicone  \nCaprylyl Methicone  \nCetearyl Methicone  \nCetyl Dimethicone  \nDimethicone  \nDimethoxysilyl Ethylenediaminopropyl Dimethicone  \nHexyl Dimethicone  \nHexyl Methicone*  \nHydroxypropyldimethicone * \nMethicone  \nStearamidopropyl Dimethicone * \nStearoxy Dimethicone  \nStearyl Dimethicone  \nStearyl Methicone * \nVinyl Dimethicone  \n \n*Not reported to be in current use.

The Expert Panelconcluded that these ingredients are safe as used as describedin that safety assessment.\n1\nBecause it has been at least 15 years since the ﬁnal report\nwas published, in accordance with Cosmetic Ingredient Re-view Procedures, the Expert Panel determined whether the\nsafety assessment should be reopened. At the June 2022\nmeeting, the Expert Panel considered updated informationregarding product types and ingredient use frequencies asreported in the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)Voluntary Cosmetic Registration Program (VCRP) database,\n2\nand the maximum use concentrations provided in response tothe survey conducted by the Personal Care Products Council(Council).\n3The frequency and concentration of use for Amyl\nAcetate has decreased from 18 to 4 uses, and from <10%\nto≤.09%, respectively.1,3In 1987, Isoamyl Acetate was not\nreported to be in use; however, according to 2022 VCRP data,this ingredient is now used in 1 formulation at up to .22%. Thecumulative frequency and concentration of use data arepresented in Table 1 .\nAn extensive search of the world ’s literature was performed\nfor studies dated 1982 forward, and new data were found.\n4-9\nThese data include subchronic inhalation toxicity data, de-\nvelopmental inhalation toxicity data, in vitro and in vivogenotoxicity data, and Research Institute for Fragrance Ma-terials, Inc. safety assessments. The Expert Panel agreed,however, that the published literature did not reveal toxicity orother data that warrant re-evaluation of the safety of theseingredients in cosmetic products.After reviewing updated frequency and concentration of\nuse data and toxicity and safety data, the Expert Panel de-termined to not reopen this safety assessment on Amyl Acetateand Isoamyl Acetate and reaf ﬁrmed the original conclusion.\nAuthor Notes\nUnpublished sources cited in this report are available from the Di-\nrector, Cosmetic Ingredient Review, 1620 L Street, NW, Suite 1200,Washington, DC 20036, USA.\nAuthor Contributions\nThe articles in this supplement were sponsored by the Cosmetic\nIngredient Review.\nDeclaration of Con ﬂicting Interest\nThe author(s) declared the following potential con ﬂicts of interest\nwith respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of thisarticle: The articles in this supplement were sponsored by theCosmetic Ingredient Review.\n*Cosmetic Ingredient Review Senior Scienti ﬁc Analyst/Writer\n**Expert Panel for Cosmetic Ingredient Safety Member***Expert Panel for Cosmetic Ingredient Safety Former Member\n†Cosmetic Ingredient Review Senior Director\n‡Cosmetic Ingredient Review Executive Director\nCorresponding Author:\nBart Heldreth, Executive Director, Cosmetic Ingredient Review, 1620 LStreet, NW, Suite 1200, Washington, DC 20036, USA.\nEmail: cirinfo@cir-safety.org\nTable 1.

Hill3, Curtis D. Klaassen3, Daniel Liebler3,\nJames G. Marks, Jr.3, Ronald C. Shank3, Thomas J. Slaga3,\nPaul W. Snyder3, and F. Alan Andersen4\nAbstract\nThe Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel (Panel) asses sed the safety of 244 plant-derived fatty acid oils as used\nin cosmetics. Oils are used in a wide variety of cosmetic pro ducts for their skin condition ing, occlusive, emollient,\nand moisturizing properties. Since many of these oils are e dible, and their systemic to xicity potential is low, the\nreview focused on potential dermal effects. The Panel conc luded that the 244 plant-derived fatty acid oils are safe as\nused in cosmetics.\nKeywords\noils, safety, cosmetics\nIntroduction\nOils derived from edible vegetables, fruits, seeds, tree, and\nground nuts have been safely consumed by, and applied to\nthe skin of, humans for thousands of years. Although nuts,\nfruits, and vegetables themse lves may cause allergic reac-\ntions in certain individuals, the refined oils derived from\nthese plants generally pose no significant safety concern\nfollowing oral exposure, and their general biology is well\ncharacterized due to extensiv e use in food materials. Ini-\ntially used for anointing in re ligious ceremonies, oils and\ntheir components have also been used on the skin for their\nskin conditioning, occlusive, emollient, moisturizing, and\nother properties.\nThe full list of ingredients in this report, which includes\noils, hydrogenated oils, unsapon ifiables, oil fatty acids, and\nsalts of the fatty acids, is foun di nT a b l e1 .A l t h o u g hal a r g e\nnumber of oils derived from plants are included in this\nsafety assessment, there is a c ommonality in that they all\nare mixtures of triglycerides that contain fatty acids and\nfatty acid derivatives, the saf ety of which in cosmetics has\nbeen established. Thus, thi s safety assessment focused\nsolely on the basic chemistry, manufacturing and production\nmethods, uses, and irritation and sensitization potential of\nthese oils as used in cos metic ingredients.\nIn preparing this report, num erous inconsistencies were\nnoted with both taxonomic and In ternational Nomenclature\nCosmetic Ingredient (INCI) naming conventions. For exam-\nple, this report includes the macadamia nut ingredients,Macadamia integrifolia seed oil and Macadamia ternifolia\nseed oil, which are described in the International Cosmetic\nIngredient Dictionary and Handbook .1The species Mi n t e g -\nrifolia is currently the only species of macadamia nut which is\nused for oil production. The name M ternifolia is an old\nnaming convention for the edible nut that is currently used\nto describe a noncultivated, inedible species. Both Mi n t e g r i -\nfolia seed oil and Mt e r n i f o l i a seed oil are the same ingredient.\nSimilar naming conflicts have been discovered with Triticum\nvulgare (wheat) germ oil and Triticum aestivum (wheat) germ\noil,Orbignya oleifera seed oil and Orbignya speciosa kernel\noil, and Moringa pterygosperma seed oil and Moringa olei-\nferaseed oil, with these pairs being synonyms for each other.\nThe shea plant also has 2 species names, Butyrospermum\nparkii andVitellaria paradoxa .O n l y Bp a r k i i (asB parkii\n1Cosmetic Ingredient Review Scientific Analyst/Writer, Cosmetic Ingredient\nReview, Washington, DC, USA\n2Cosmetic Ingredient Review Senior Director, Cosmetic Ingredient Review,\nWashington, DC, USA\n3Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel Member, Cosmetic Ingredient\nReview, Washington, DC, USA\n4Cosmetic Ingredient Review Former Director, Cosmetic Ingredient Review,\nWashington, DC, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nBart Heldreth, Executive Director, Cosmetic Ingredient Review, 1620 L Street,\nNW, Suite 1200, Washington, DC 20036, USA.\nEmail: cirinfo@cir-safety.orgInternational Journal of Toxicology\n2017, Vol. 36(Supplement 3) 51S-129S\nªThe Author(s) 2017\nReprints and permission:\nsagepub.com/journalsPermissions.nav\nDOI: 10.1177/1091581817740569\njournals.sagepub.com/home/ijt\nTable 1.

For\nexample, sunflower oil contains high levels of vitamins A, D,\nand K, whereas palm oil is a rich source of vitamins A and E.\nCrude sunflower oil also has the highest content of vitamin E in\nthe form of a-tocopherol among vegetable oils.3\nVegetable oil and hydrogenated vegetable oil are cosmetic\nlabeling names for blends of plant-derived oils.5The composi-\ntion of a blend is determined by the desired physical properties.\nVegetable oil and hydrogenated vegetable oil may include, but\nare not limited to, canola oil, Brassica campestris (rapeseed)\noil,Carthamus tinctorius (safflower) seed oil, Helianthus\nannuus (sunflower) seed oil, Sesamum indicum (sesame) seed\noil,Elaeis guineensis (palm) oil, E guineensis (palm kernel) oil,\nCocos nucifera (coconut) oil, Gossypium herbaceum (cotton-\nseed) oil, Glycine soja (soybean) oil, Zea mays (corn) oil, Olea\neuropaea (olive) oil, Prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond)\noil, and hydrogenated products of these oils.\nMethod of Manufacturing\nThe oil may be directly expressed from the source (seed or\npulp) followed by solvent extraction. Bailey Industrial Oil and\nFat Products states that the removal of pigments and polar\nmaterials is mandatory for most cosmetic applications.6The\nprocess used for oil refining for foods may be adequate for this\npurpose, or additional steps may be required. Special refining\nmethods to yield colorless and odorless oils are used by the\ncosmetic industry and include proprietary adsorption chroma-\ntography and supercritical fluid extractions.\nThe majority of the oils presented in this report are produced\neither from mechanical extraction or solvent extraction or a\nhybrid of both methods, known as prepress solvent extraction.3\nIn solvent extraction, hexane is the most commonly used sol-\nvent, as it is economical and easily removed from the extracted\noil. Seeds that are rich in oil can be cold pressed to extract oil\nwithout the use of solvents.7\nAfter the initial extraction by methods such as solvent\nextraction, the crude (degummed) oil is often refined.3The first\nstep is treating the oil with caustic soda to neutralize free fatty\nacids, hydrolyze phosphatides, and remove some colored pig-\nments and unsaponifiable materials. Soap stock is usually a by-\nproduct of this step. The next step involves treating the neu-\ntralized oil with activated earth to further adsorb pigments. The\nlast major step in refining oil is deodorizing, usually by a type\nof steam distillation, which is intended to remove all oxidative\ncleavage products that impart odor or flavor to the oil. Deodor-\nization also removes tocopherols, sterols, and other minor con-\nstituents of free fatty acids and undesirable foreign materials.\nFigure 2 is a flowchart of the basic refinement process.\nAfter deodorization, oils can be further processed by hydro-\ngenation, which makes oil more resistant to oxidative and ther-\nmal damage, and by winterization, where oil is slowly cooled to\npromote formation of crystals that cause cloudiness, and then\nfiltered to remove the crystals.\nCosmetic grade fatty acid plant oils may include a physical\nrefining step that involves heating crude oil under vacuum.7This step allows for the removal of volatile components such as\ncolor compounds, odor compounds, and free fatty acids, which\ngives the refined oil a lighter color, less odor, and lower acid\nvalues.\nAnalytical Methods\nNear-infrared spectroscopy and gas chromatography have been\nused, respectively, to phenotype and analyze fatty acid profiles\nin shea fat (described as V paradoxa , not B parkii ).8The fatty\nacid composition of hazel seed oil ( Corylus avellana , in crude\nform) has also been analyzed by gas chromatography.9The\ntriacylglycerol and diacylglycerol composition oils from hazel-\nnut, pistachio, almond, Brazil nut, and macadamia nuts have\nbeen characterized using high-performance liquid chromato-\ngraphy with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization and\nUV detection.10The triacylglycerol profile of Brazil nut oil\nhas also been quantified using dry matrix-assisted laser deso-\nrption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.11\nImpurities\nProteins. Many edible fatty acid oils are derived from foods that\nare recognized as potent food allergens. It has been shown that\nan individual who is allergic to a food will generally not react\nto the refined oil, especially if the oil has been “hot pressed” or\nhas undergone more processing.12,13A prime example is Ara-\nchis hypogaea (peanut) oil. Peanuts are extremely allergenic to\na large population, but reaction to the oil is rare. In its safety\nassessment on A hypogaea (peanut) oil, the Panel noted that the\nmajor concern associated with allergic reactions to peanuts is\nthe protein.14The protein does not partition into the refined oil,\nand therefore, the oil is safe for use in cosmetics. However,\nresearchers have reported protein levels in processed oils. Hal-\nsey et al reported that Lowry protein determinations of cold-\npressed and refined sunflower oil were found to be 2 to 8 mg/\nmL protein,15whereas Zitouni et al reported trace amounts of\nprotein in the refined oil.16Olszewski et al found 0.1 to 0.2 mg\nprotein per gram of peanut oil,17whereas Ramazzotti et al\nreported finding immunoglobulin E (IgE)-responsive residual\nproteins in peanut oil extracts.18Porras et al found soy protein\nin some samples of soy oil, but not others.19Awazuhara et al\nreported 1.4 to 4.0 mg protein per 100 g of soy oil.20Although\nPaschke et al found approximately 35 mg/L protein content in\nrefined soybean oil, no IgE-binding activity was detectable.21\nAlthough the Panel has found a general lack of clinical\neffects for fatty acid oils already reviewed,14,22–30other groups\nhave raised concerns. The Eu ropean Medicines Agency\n(EMEA) Working Party on Herbal Medicinal Products con-\ncluded that soy and peanut products “should be treated as aller-\ngenic unless they have an analytically monitored non-\nallergenic specification and a safe maximum daily dose.”31The\nEMEA found that threshold concentrations for induction of a\nprotein contact dermatitis were not available and recom-\nmended, “all medications for topical use containing soya or\npeanut products should be treated as allergenic.”74S International Journal of Toxicology 36(Supplement 3)Aflatoxin. Aflatoxins are metabolic products of the molds Asper-\ngillus flavus andAspergillus parasiticus . They are most often\nproduced in stored agricultural crops (such as peanuts and other\nnut crops) when growth conditions and genetic requirements\nare favorable.32–34The International Agency for Research on\nCancer (IARC) categorized aflatoxins as group 1 agents,\n“carcinogenic to humans.”35,36\nThe US government places the following limitations on pea-\nnuts to be considered “negative” for aflatoxin: /C2015 ppb for\n“peanuts which have been certified as meeting edible quality\ngrade requirements” and /C2025 ppb for “nonedible quality\ncategories” (7 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) sections\n997.30 and 998.200).37Aflatoxin contamination was not a con-\ncern in the previous CIR safety assessments of peanut oil,17\nhazelnut oil,41or coconut oil.29\nGlycidol. Glycidol and glycidol fatty acid esters have been\ndetected in refined fatty acid oils.38–41\nGossypol. Gossypol reportedly is present in refined cottonseed\noil at a concentration of /C200.01%.24The concentration ofgossypol in modified cottonseed products intended for human\nconsumption is limited by federal regulation (21CFR 112.894).\nUse\nCosmetic\nThe safety of the cosmetic ingredients addressed in this safety\nassessment is evaluated based on data received from the US\nFood and Drug Administration (FDA) and the cosmetics indus-\ntry on the expected use of these ingredients in cosmetics. Use\nfrequencies of individual ingredients in cosmetics are collected\nfrom manufacturers and reported by cosmetic product category\nin the FDA Voluntary Cosmetic Registration Program (VCRP)\ndatabase. Use concentration data are submitted by the cosmetic\nindustry in response to a survey, conducted by the Personal\nCare Products Council, of maximum reported use concentra-\ntions by product category.\nThere are 244 oil ingredients included in this safety assess-\nment, 146 of which are reported to be used; 118 of the in-use\ningredients have never been reviewed by CIR, while 28 haveCrude  Oil \nDegummed Oil Lecithin Sludge \nAlkali Refined Oil Soap Stock \nSalad Oil \nCooking Oil Salad and \nCooking Oil Partially \nHydrogenated Oil \nOther Fatty Oil \nShortening \nStockBlended Oils \nMargarine Stock Bleached Oil Salad Oil Water\nAlkali \nDeodorizationDeodorization Deodorization \nDeodorization \nDeodorization \nDeodorization Activated Earth \nH2, Catalyst \nWinterization & \nDeodorization \nFigure 2.

For the ingredients being reviewed\nfor the first time, the frequency of use42and/or concentration of\nuse43–45can be found in Table 5. (Also included in Table 5 are 3\ningredients, Citrullus vulgaris (watermelon) seed oil, macada-\nmia nut oil, and Vaccinium oxycoccos (cranberry) seed oil, that\ndo not have identifiable INCI names; these ingredients are not\npart of this assessment, but they are very similar to the oils that\nare part of this assessment, and in f o r m a t i o no nt h e mi si n c l u d e di n\nthis report for completeness.) For the ingredients that have been\nreviewed previously, the current and historical23–26,28,46–48fre-\nquency and concentration of use is given in Table 6. The 97 ingre-\ndients not currently reported t o be used are listed in Table 7.42–45,49,50\nOf the oils included in this report, Bp a r k i i (shea) butter has\nthe most reported uses in cosmetic and personal care products,\nwith a total of 1,950; 1,680 of those uses are in leave-on\nformulations. A recent survey of use concentrations for B\nparkii (shea) butter reports a max imum use concentration of\n60%in leave-on products as a cu ticle softener, a manicuring\napplication.51Helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil has the\nsecond greatest number of overall uses reported, with a total\nof 1,414; 1,054 of those uses are in leave-on formulations,\nhaving use concentrations up to 96 %. Many other ingredients\nare used in an extensive number of formulations. For exam-\nple, prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil, O europaea\n(olive) fruit oil, and Gs o j a (soybean) oil have 1,127, 915, and\n912 uses, respectively. Most o f the in-use ingredients have\nuses in both leave-on and rinse-off product types, many are\nused in products that are applied around the eye and some are\nused in a way they can possibly be ingested. Some are used in\nproducts that involve mucous membrane exposure, and a few\nare used in underarm deodorant formulations. Many of the\nproducts are used in formulati ons at relatively high concen-\ntrations. Olea europaea ( o l i v e )f r u i to i li su s e da tu pt o1 0 0 %,\nPersea gratissima (avocado) oil is used at up to 98 %,H\nannuus ( s u n f l o w e r )s e e do i la tu pt o9 6 %,a n d Gs o j a (soy-\nbean) oil at 95 %.\nOils are used in a wide variety of cosmetic products for their\nskin conditioning, occlusive, emollient, moisturizing, and other\nproperties. Some of the oils included in this report are used in\nproducts that can be inhaled, and effects on the lungs that may\nbe induced by aerosolized products containing these ingredi-\nents are of concern. The particle size of aerosol hair sprays and\nof pump hair sprays is 38 and >80 mm, respectively, and is\nrelatively large compared to respirable particle sizes ( /C2010\nmm). Therefore, because of their size, most aerosol particles\nare deposited in the nasopharyngeal region and are not\nrespirable.\nNone of the oils, hydrogenate d oils, unsaponifiables, oil\nfatty acids, and salts of the fatty acids described in this report\nwere restricted from use in any way under the rules governing\ncosmetic products in the European Union.52\nNoncosmetic\nThe primary use of plant-derived fatty acid oils is for cooking.\nPalm oil is the world’s most widely consumed edible oil (41.7million metric tons), followed by soybean oil, rapeseed oil,\nsunflower seed oil, cottonseed oil, peanut oil, palm kernel oil,\ncoconut oil, and olive oil.3,53Nonfood, noncosmetic uses for\nedible fatty acid oils are found in Table 8.\nToxicological Studies\nMany of the fatty acid oils in this assessment are edible, and\nexposure to the oils from food use would result in a much larger\nsystemic dose than that resulting from use in cosmetic prod-\nucts. Consequently, their systemic toxicity potential, except as\ndiscussed below relating to carcinogenicity, is not addressed in\nthis report. The safety focus of use of these oils as cosmetic\ningredients is the potential for irritation and sensitization.\nCarcinogenicity\nThe safety of glycidol fatty acid esters in refined vegetable oils\nwas assessed by IARC. Glycidol was determined to be a group\n2A (probably carcinogenic to humans) chemical, while glyci-\nd o lf a t t ya c i de s t e r sw e r ed e t e r m i n e dt ob eag r o u p3( n o t\nclassifiable as to carcinogenicity to humans) chemical.40,41\nThe Federal Institute for Risk Assessment in Germany\nreleased a summary of their initial evaluation of the assessment\nof levels of glycidol fatty acid esters detected in refined vege-\ntable fats.39Although acknowledging that the levels of glycidol\nthat may be released from glycidol fatty acid esters are not\nknown, the evaluation noted that glycidol is classified as prob-\nably carcinogenic to humans. The evaluation was based on\nfindings of the German Chemical and Veterinary Test Agency\nthat noted that glycidol is converted to 3-chloropropanediol and\nit appeared to be the 3-chloropropanediol that was detected in\nthe vegetable fat.38The levels of 3-chloropropanediol were\nnegligible at the crude oil, degummed, neutralized, and\nbleached stages, but levels were significant at the deodorized\nstage.\nAnacardium occidentale (Cashew) Seed Oil\nThe modulatory effect of A occidentale (cashew) seed oil on\nantioxidant potential was investigated in female Swiss albino\nmice in a 120-day skin papillomagenesis study.54The mice\nwere divided into 4 groups of 15 and 1 group of 10 (vehicle\ncontrol). Test groups were as follows: group I was the vehicle\ncontrol, receiving 0.1 mL acetone; group II was the positive\ncontrol, receiving a single dose of 7,12-dimethylbenz( a)anthra-\ncene (DMBA; 0.005 mg/0.05 mL acetone) followed by appli-\ncations of 2 %croton oil 3 times a week until study termination;\ngroup III received a single dose of DMBA followed by appli-\ncations of 2.5 %cashew nut kernel oil 3 times a week until\nstudy termination; group IV received a single dose of DMBA\nfollowed by applications of 5 %cashew nut kernel oil 3 times a\nweek until study termination; and group V received 5 %cashew\nnut kernel oil applied until study termination. The oil was\napplied to the clipped dorsal scapular region that was 2 cm in\ndiameter. Body weights were recorded at regular intervals.76S International Journal of Toxicology 36(Supplement 3)Table 5.

Elaeis guineensis (palm) oil, 5%,\nwas nonallergenic in a maximization study23\nGossypium herbaceum (cotton) seed oil\nCosmetic formulations containing 3.4% to 8.97% hydrogenated cottonseed oil were not irritating to rabbit skin24\nOryza sativa (rice) bran oil\nUndiluted Oryza sativa (rice) bran oil was not irritating to rabbits, and in a guinea pig maximization study, no reactions were observed\nwhen 5% was used at induction and 25% and 50% Oryza sativa (rice) bran oil were used at challenge. An Oryza sativa (rice) bran oil/\nOryza sativa (rice) germ oil mixture, concentrations not stated, did not cause a contact allergy response. Undiluted hydrolyzed rice\nprotein was also not irritating or sensitizing25\nOryza sativa (rice) germ oil\nOryza sativa (rice) germ oil was not a primary dermal irritant25\nPrunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil\nUndiluted prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil and 2 moisturizer formulations, each containing 25% prunus amygdalus dulcis\n(sweet almond) oil, were tested for skin irritancy in rabbits using occlusive patches. Undiluted prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet\nalmond) oil was nonirritating (primary irritation index, PII ¼0/4). The formulations containing 25% prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet\nalmond) oil were minimally irritating (PIIs ¼0.28 and 0.72, respectively).\nIn a 60-day cumulative irritation test, 10% and 100% prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil was applied to rabbits. When tested\nin 7 separate trials, 100% prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil produced mean maximum irritation indices (MMIIs) ranging\nfrom 0.34 to 1.34 (maximum score ¼8). At a concentration of 10%, MMIIs for this ingredient ranged from 0 to 0.66. Results\nindicated that, when applied to the skin over a long period of time, prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil is slightly irritating;\nwhereas at 10%, it is practically nonirritating\nA maximization assay was used to determine the sensitizing potential of prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil using guinea\npigs. Intradermal induction used concentrations of 5% amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil, the dose-range phase of the\nexperiment used a single dermal application of 5%, 10%, or 100% Prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil, a booster induction\ninjection of 100% Prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil was applied occlusively for 48 hours 1 week later, challenge was\nwith 5% prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil in petrolatum applied topically under occlusion for 24 hours. Prunus amygdalus\ndulcis (sweet almond) oil was nonsensitizing\nUndiluted prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil was tested for irritancy in groups of 6 male albino rabbits. The test material\nwas applied under occlusion to the clipped intact and abraded dorsal skin of each animal. Twenty-three hours later, patches were\nremoved; sites were scored at 24 and 48 hours. The primary irritation indices (PIIs) for 7 test samples of prunus amygdalus dulcis\n(sweet almond) oil ranged from 0 to 0.18 (maximum score ¼8), indicating that this ingredient is practically nonirritating to skin208\n(continued)Burnett et al 95Sguinea pig skin, and 5 %aqueous solutions of a bar soap con-\ntaining 13 %sodium cocoate had irritation scores of 1.6 to 4.0\nof 8 in animal studies. However, the majority of the remaining\nanimal irritation and/or sensitization studies conducted on a\nlarge number of the oils included in this report, primarily in\nformulation, did not report any significant irritation or sensiti-\nzation reactions, indicating that refined oils derived from plants\nare not dermal irritants or sensitizers. None of the tested oils,\nincluding B parkii (shea) butter (up to 20 %) and Oryza sativa\n(rice) germ oil ( /C2075%), were phototoxic in animal studies. The\ncomedogenicity of C avellana (hazel) seed oil was evaluated\nusing rabbits, and a slight difference in the number and size of\nthe pilosebaceous follicles and a slight excess of sebum and a\ndilation of the follicles were observed.\nHuman\nPlant-derived fatty acid oils are commonly believed to be safe\nfor use on the skin.6de Groot notes that no documentation\nexists to show that high-quality edible lipids cause adverse\nreactions in normal individuals (except for potential comedo-\ngenicity).55Very few reports of adverse reactions to cosmetic\nuse of edible fatty acid oils have been reported.\nMany plant-derived fatty acid oils are derived from foods\nthat are recognized as potent food allergens. The allergic reac-\ntions are thought to be caused by the proteins present in the\nfood. It has been shown that an individual who is allergic to a\nfood will generally not react to the refined oil, especially if theoil has been “hot pressed” or has undergone more process-\ning.12,13In its safety assessment on A hypogaea (peanut) oil,\nthe Panel noted that while peanuts are extremely allergenic to a\nlarge population, reaction to the oil is rare. The major concern\nassociated with allergic reactions to peanuts is the protein,14\nwhich does not partition into the refined oil; therefore, the oil is\nsafe for use in cosmetics. Crevel et al also concluded that\nchemically refined peanut oil is safe for the majority of peanut\nallergic individuals.13They stated that “as peanut is acknowl-\nedged to be one of the most potent food allergens, it is reason-\nable to extrapolate the conclusions drawn up for peanut oil to\nother edible oils.” However, they concede that validated ana-\nlytical methodology for establishing the protein content of oil is\nneeded.\nIn support of the conclusions stated earlier, Crevel et al also\nexamined the allergenicity of some other oils. Very few\ninstances of allergic reactions to other major edible fatty acid\noils have been reported. Even sesame oil, which differs from\nthe other oils, is used as a flavorant and, therefore, is not\nrefined, is expected to contain significantly more protein than\nthe other edible fatty acid oils, and has had very few reports of\nallergic reaction. Additional studies demonstrating safety are\nsummarized later in this section.15,56\nA large number of clinical irritation and sensitization studies\nwere made available on many of the oils, primarily in formula-\ntion, and these studies are summarized in Table 11. All of the\ndata indicated that the oils were not irritants or sensitizers.\nSummary statements of human dermal studies, includingTable 10.

Although\nthe majority of the oils were nonirritating to mildly irritating, a few\nstudies indicated some significant irritation. For example, a lotion\ncontaining 1.5 %E guineensis (palm) oil was moderately irritating\nto rabbit eyes, and a mascara containing 9.4 %Linum usitatissimum\n(linseed) seed oil was predicted to be moderately irritating in an\nalternative assay. Available ocu lar irritation studies are summar-\nized in Table 13. Summary statements of ocular irritation studies\nfrom previous CIR reports on oils are provided in Table 14.\nHuman\nIn clinical ocular irritation studies, formulations containing\n9.4%L usitatissimum (linseed) oil and 0.2 %Ribes nigrum\n(blackcurrant) seed oil did not produce adverse reactions and\nwere considered safe for contact lens wearers. These studies are\nalso summarized in Table 13.\nClinical Studies\nClinical Trials/Case Studies\nPlant-derived fatty acid oils have been used as vehicles for\ndelivery of therapeutic agents or used alone in treating skin\ndisorders. Adverse reactions to the oils were notably absentin such clinical tests. Case studies have reported isolated aller-\ngic reactions. The available data are summarized in Table 15.\nSummary\nThe report addresses the safety of plant-derived fatty acid oils.\nThese oils, which are derived from vegetable and fruit plants,\nare composed of monoglycerides, diglycerides, and primarily\ntriglycerides, free fatty acids, and other minor components,\nincluding natural antioxidants and fat-soluble vitamins. The\npercentage of chemical constituents and nutritional content of\nindividual oil types is dependent on region where the oil plant\nis grown, individual cultivars, and plant genetics. Oils used in\ncosmetics are likely produced in the same manner as those used\nin the food industry. Oils may be expressed through mechanical\nor solvent extraction. The oils may undergo further refining,\nsuch as neutralizing, bleaching, and deodorizing, to remove pig-\nments, odors, unsaponifiable materials, and other undesirables.\nSo that all plant-derived fatty acid oils that are cosmetic\ningredients are included in 1 report, several ingredients that\nhave been reviewed previously by the Panel are included in\nthis report. The ingredients, their conclusions, and citations are\nfound in Table 2. Some study results utilized in those previous\nsafety assessments were also utilized in this safety assessment\nand cited below where appropriate.\nIndividuals who have food allergies to a plant protein rarely\nexhibit allergic reactions when exposed to refined oils of the\nsame plant. Data evaluation by the Panel regarding the method\nof manufacture indicates that protein constituents do not parti-\ntion into the refined oils. The Panel has also found a general lack\nof clinical effects for fatty acid oils that they have already\nreviewed; however, other researchers have raised concerns about\nthe presence of residual proteins in oils, such as peanut and soy.Table 11.

Cosmetic formulations\ncontaining 10.6% to 20.86% hydrogenated cottonseed oil were not irritating or sensitizing.24\nOryza sativa (rice) bran oil\nRice is generally regarded as hypoallergenic, although some case studies of allergic reactions to raw rice have been reported. In\nclinical testing, formulations containing 1.04% to 8.0% Oryza sativa (rice) bran oil were not irritating or sensitizing. Hydrolyzed rice\nprotein was not irritating to human participants.25\nPersea gratissima (avocado) oil\nPersea gratissima (avocado) oil was not an irritant or sensitizer when human participants were patch tested with cosmetic\nformulations containing up to 10.7% Persea gratissima (avocado) oil or in patch tests using 100% Persea gratissima (avocado) oil.27\nPrunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil\nUndiluted Prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil was nonirritating in a single insult patch test with 101 participants, and it was\nnonirritating and nonsensitizing in an HRIPT using 52 participants. Cosmetic formulations containing 0.1% to -5% were practically\nnonirritating and nonsensitizing in HRIPTs performed with 6,906 participants.

The safety focus of use\nof these oils as cosmetic ingredients is on the potential for\nirritation and sensitization. Undiluted, technical grade, A hypo-\ngaea (peanut) oil was moderately irritating to rabbits and gui-\nnea pig skin, and 5 %aqueous solutions of a bar soap containing\n13%sodium cocoate had irritation scores of 1.6 to 4.0 of 8 in\nanimal studies. However, the majority of the remaining animal\nirritation and/or sensitization studies conducted on a large num-\nber of the oils included in this report, primarily in formulation,\ndid not report any significant irritation or sensitizationreactions, indicating that refined oils derived from plants are\nnot dermal irritants or sensiti zers. None of the tested oils,\nincluding B parkii (shea) butter (up to 20 %) and O sativa (rice)\ngerm oil ( /C2075%), were phototoxic in animal studies. The\ncomedogenicity of C avellana (hazel) seed oil was evaluated\nusing rabbits, and a slight difference in the number and size of\nthe pilosebaceous follicles and a slight excess of sebum and a\ndilation of the follicles were observed.\nThe results of a large number of clinical irritation, sensitiza-\ntion, and photoxicity/photosensitziation studies indicated that\nplant-derived fatt acid oils were not irritants or sensitizers in\nhumans. In clinical testing with an eye mask containing 0.2 %\nRibes nigrum (blackcurrant) seed oil (undiluted), the formula-\ntion was noncomedogenic.Table 14.

An eye mask containing 0.2 %R nigrum (black-\ncurrant) seed oil (undiluted) was tested and considered safe for\ncontact lens wearers.\nPlant-derived fatty acid oils have been used as vehicles for\ndelivery of therapeutic agents or used alone in treating skin\ndisorders. Adverse reactions to the oils were notably absentin such clinical tests. Case studies have reported isolated aller-\ngic reactions.\nDiscussion\nPlant-derived fatty acid oils, oils which have been hydroge-\nnated to reduce or eliminate unsaturation, fatty acid salts, and\noil unsaponifiables were reviewed by the Panel. Most of these\ningredients in this report are mixtures of triglycerides contain-\ning fatty acids and fatty acid derivatives, the safety of which in\ncosmetics has been established. Upon review of these ingredi-\nents, the Panel expressed concern regarding gossypol (for\ncotton-derived ingredients), pesticide residues, and heavy\nmetals that may be present in botanical ingredients. The Panel\nstressed that the cosmetics industry should continue to use theTable 15. (continued)\nIngredient Patients/condition Effect/observation Reference\nOlea europaea (olive) fruit oil\nOlea europaea (olive) fruit oil Throughout the literature, it is stated that sensitization to\nOlea europaea (olive) fruit oil is considered rare. Case\nreports have been described, however, and generally\ninvolved patients with venous eczema, some type of\ndermatitis or lesion, or an occupational exposure. Patch\ntesting with Olea europaea (olive) fruit oil produced positive\nreactions in most of these cases, and these results were\nusually regarded as allergenic. The concentrations of Olea\neuropaea (olive) fruit oil tested were not always given, but,\nwhen stated, test concentrations giving positive results,\nranged from 30% to100%. When the constituents of olive oil\nwere tested as well, the results of that testing were negative.318–325\nOlea europaea (olive) fruit oil Whether the reactions to olive oil were contact\nsensitization or irritation were investigated using open and\nocclusive testing. It was concluded that olive oil presented as\na weak irritant rather than a contact sensitizer in the few\ncase studies was observed.326\nPersea gratissima (avocado) oil\nPersea gratissima (avocado)\noil1 female; dermatitis around the\neyes and earlobesPatch testing with her sunscreen resulted in positive results. In\nsubsequent patch testing of the ind ividual ingredients, a positive\nreaction to undiluted oil, but not to the active ingredient, was\nobserved; 20 control participants were involved, and reactions\ntoPersea gratissima (avocado) oil were not seen.327\nSesamum indicum (sesame) seed oil\nSesamum indicum (sesame)\nseed oil in an ointmentFemale Pruritic erythema, papules, and vesicles appeared after\napplication of the ointment; patch testing was performed\nwith the ointment and with the individual ingredients,\nincluding undiluted Sesamum indicum (sesame) seed oil.\nBoth the ointment and Sesamum indicum (sesame) seed oil\nproduced positive reactions on days 2, 3, 4, and 1; the other\ncomponents did not cause a reaction.\nResults were negative in patch testing of Sesamum indicum\n(sesame) seed oil using 20 healthy participants.328\nAbbreviations: IgE, immunoglubulin E; IgG4, immunoglobulin G4.114S International Journal of Toxicology 36(Supplement 3)necessary procedures to limit these impurities in the ingredient\nbefore blending into cosmetic formulations.\nAdditionally, the Panel considered the safety of glycidol\nand glycidol fatty acid esters in refined vegetable oils.\nAlthough the Panel recognizes that these impurities may be\ncarcinogenic, absorption through the skin would be very low\nand likely does not pose a significant hazard. Nonetheless,\nsuppliers should take steps to eliminate or reduce the presence\nof glycidol and glycidol fatty acid esters in plant-based fatty\nacid oils that are used in cosmeti c products. Aflatoxins, which\nare potent carcinogens, may be present in moldy nuts and\ncoconut copra but are not found i no i l se x p r e s s e df r o mt h e s e\nnuts and copra. The Panel adopted the US Department of\nAgriculture designation of /C2015 ppb as corresponding to\n“negative” aflatoxin content.\nCertain plant-derived oils are used in cosmetic products that\nmay be inhaled during their use. In practice, however, the par-\nticle sizes produced by the cosmetic aerosols are not respirable.\nThe Panel discussed the relationship between food allergies\nand exposure to refined oils. Individuals who have food aller-\ngies to a plant protein rarely exhibit allergic reactions when\nexposed to refined oils of the same plant. The Panel has found a\ngeneral lack of clinical effects for plant-derived fatty acid oils\nalready reviewed.\nFatty acid composition data were available for the majority\nof the oils included in this review and the Panel agreed that the\ncomposition data, in combination with the available data on\nmethod of manufacture, impur ities, safety test data, a long\nhistory of safe use in foods, and an absence of adverse reactions\nin clinical experience, were a sufficient basis for determining\nsafety. The Panel did note that vegetable oil is a blend of a\nnumber of different oils and that a specific composition of\nvegetable oil was not available. The Panel determined that the\nsafety of vegetable oil as used in cosmetic formulations has\nbeen established, providing t hat the blend contains oils for\nwhich the fatty acid composition is known.\nAdditionally, although data on th e fatty acid composition of\nFragaria vesca (strawberry) seed oil and Fragaria virginiana\n(strawberry) seed oil were not available, data were available for\nFragaria ananassa (strawberry) seed oil and Fragaria chiloensis\n(strawberry) seed oil. In that the fatty acid compositions of F ana-\nnassa andF chiloensis (strawberry) seed oil were similar to each\nother and it was assumed that Fv e s c a andF virginiana (strawberry)\nseed oils would also have similar fatty acid compositions.\nThe Panel also noted that arachidonic acid is a fatty acid\nconstituent of Lycium barbarum seed oil, O sativa (rice) germ\noil, and Sclerocarya birrea seed oil. Although a previously\npublished CIR evaluation concluded that insufficient data exist\nto support the safety of arachidonic acid in cosmetic products,\nthe Panel was of the opinion that the concentration of use of\nthese ingredients was sufficiently low that the amount of free\narachidonic acid from these oils would not warrant concern.\nFinally, the conclusion reached by the Panel on the safety of\nthe plant-derived fatty acid oils supersedes the 2001 conclusion\nof insufficient data for Corylus americana and C avellana\n(hazel) seed oil.Conclusion\nThe Panel concluded that the 244 plant-derived fatty acid oils\nincluded in this review are safe in the present practices of use\nand concentration described in this safety assessment. Were\ningredients not in current use (as indicated by *) to be used\nin the future, the expectation is that they would be used in\nproduct categories and concentrations comparable to others\nin this group.

Hill3, Curtis D. Klaassen3,\nDaniel C. Liebler3, James G. Marks Jr3, Ronald C. Shank3,\nThomas J. Slaga3, Paul W. Snyder3, and F. Alan Andersen4\nAbstract\nAnthemis nobilis (Roman chamomile) flower extract, anthemis nobilis flower oil, anthemis nobilis flower powder, and anthemis\nnobilis flower water are ingredients that function as fragrance ingredients and skin-conditioning agents in cosmetic products.\nThese ingredients are being used at concentrations up to 10% (anthemis nobilis flower water) in cosmetic products. The available\ndata indicate that these 4 ingredients are not irritating or sensitizing. Chemical composition data and the low use concentrations\nsuggest that systemic toxicity would not be likely if percutaneous absorption of constituents were to occur. Formulations may\ncontain more than 1 botanical ingredient; each may contribute to the final concentration of a single component. Manufacturers\nwere cautioned to avoid reaching levels of plant constituents that may cause sensitization or other adverse effects. Industry should\ncontinue to use good manufacturing practices to limit impurities in the ingredient before blending into cosmetic formulations. The\nExpert Panel concluded that these ingredients are safe in the present practices of use and concentration in cosmetics, when\nformulated to be nonsensitizing.\nKeywords\nAnthemis nobilis , safety, cosmetics\nIntroduction\nThis report presents information relevant to evaluating the\nsafety of the following 4 Roman chamomile1orAnthemis nobilis–\nderived ingredients as used in cosmetics: anthemis nobilis\nflower extract, anthemis nobilis flower oil, anthemis nobilis\nflower powder, and anthemis nobilis flower water. The Cosmetic\nIngredient Review (CIR) is evaluating 11 Chamomilla recutita\n(German chamomile)–derived ingredients in a separate report\nbecause the CIR Expert Panel thought that these 2 groups of\nbotanical ingredients were substantially different and should not\nbe addressed in the same report. These An o b i l i s –derived ingre-\ndients function as fragrance ingredients and skin-conditioning\nagents in cosmetic products. Composition data are available on\nanthemis nobilis flower oil, as well as samples of the whole plant\nand the flower of An o b i l i s . The Panel agreed that these data are\nadequate to support assumptions about the likely compositions of\nother An o b i l i s –derived ingredients.\nChemistry\nThe plant source of the ingredi ents reviewed in this safety\nassessment is A nobilis L. (Asteraceae). Compositae family is\nthe previous or historical name for the Asteraceae family.\nChamaemelum nobile is a synonym for A nobilis .1Thedefinitions of the 4 chamomile ingredients presented in this\nsafety assessment are included in Table 1.\nPhysical and Chemical Properties\nAnthemis nobilis flower oil is a light blue or light blue-green\nliquid with a specific gravity of between 0.892 and 0.910\n(Table 2). Information on the remaining 3 ingredients was not\nfound nor was unpublished information provided.\nMethod of Manufacture\nAnthemis nobilis flower oil. The preparation of anthemis nobilis\nflower oil involves the steam distillation of the dried flowers of\nA nobilis as a key step.2\n1Cosmetic Ingredient Review Scientific Analyst/Writer, Washington, DC, USA\n2Cosmetic Ingredient Review Chemist, Washington, DC, USA\n3Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel Member, Washington, DC, USA\n4Former Director, Cosmetic Ingredient Review, Washington, DC, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nLillian J.

Ash and fat\ncontents were low, and the energetic contribution was 389.88\nkcal/100 g dry weight. The main sugar found in A nobilis was\nfructose, followed by glucose and sucrose. Trehalose was\nfound in lower amounts. Polyunsaturated fatty acids predomi-\nnated over saturated fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty\nacids. The fatty acids determined in higher percentages were\nlinoleic acid (C18:2n6), oleic acid (C18 1n9), a-linolenic acid\n(C18:3n3), and palmitic acid (C16:0).

This mixture, also known by another trade name, has\nthe same extraction solvent, propylene glycol, and water. The\nocular irritation potential of this trade name mixture was eval-\nuated using 6 New Zealand hybrid albino male rabbits.21The\nmixture (20 %[vol/vol] solution in distilled water; volume ¼0.1\nmL) was instilled into the inferior conjunctival sac of the right\neye. Reactions were scored 1 hour postinstillation and then 1, 2,\n4, and, possibly, 7 days postinstillation. The diluted mixture was\nclassified as a very slight ocular irritant.\nSkin Irritation\nAnimal\nAnthemis nobilis flower extract. One trade name mixtures asso-\nciated with anthemis nobilis flower extract has the INCI name,propylene glycol (and) water (and) anthemis nobilis flower\nextract, and contains 5 %to 9.9%anthemis nobilis flower extract\n(Table 3). The skin irritation potential of this mixture (20 %[vol/\nvol] solution in distilled water) was evaluated using 6 New\nZealand hybrid albino male rabbits.21The trade name mixture\nwas applied to intact and scarified skin sites (on clipped flank) at\na dose of 0.5 mL per area per animal. The test material remained\nin contact with the skin for 24 hours. Reactions were scored\napproximately 30 minutes after patch removal and 48 hours\nlater. The trade name mixture was classified as a nonirritant.\nAnthemis nobilis flower oil. Undiluted anthemis nobilis flower\noil was applied to the backs of hairless mice (number and strain\nnot stated). Details relating to the test procedure were not\nreported. The oil was classified as nonirritating.2In another\ntest, undiluted anthemis nobilis flower oil was applied (under\nocclusion) to intact or abraded skin of rabbits (number and\nstrain not stated) for 24 hours.

These induction applications were repeated daily\nfor 3 weeks. Reactions were scored either at the end of the\napplication period or at the end of each week. The guinea pigs\nwere challenged with the oil (on contralateral flank) on days 21\nand 25. Ten guinea pigs served as controls. The anthemis nobi-\nlis flower oil solution was not allergenic in this study.\nHuman\nPredictive testing. The skin sensitization potential of a leave-\non skin care lotion containing 3 %(0.03%solids) anthemis\nnobilis flower extract was evaluated in an HRIPT using 104\npatients (between 18 and 70 years old).23The test substance\n(0.2 mL, under patch [type not stated]) was applied to the upper\nback, between the scapulae, for 24 hours on Mondays, Wednes-\ndays, and Fridays. This procedure was repeated for a total of 9\ninduction applications (same test site). Reactions were scored\n24 hours after patch removal on Tuesdays and Thursdays and\n48 hours after patch removal on Saturdays. Following a 2-\nweek, nontreatment period, a challenge patch was applied for\n24 hours to a previously untreated site on the back. Reactions\nwere scored at the time of patch removal and at 48 and 72\nhours. No clinically significant dermal reactions were observed\nduring the study. The authors concluded that the skin care\nlotion did not demonstrate a potential for eliciting dermal irri-\ntation or sensitization.\nAnthemis nobilis flower oil. The skin sensitization potential of\nanthemis nobilis flower oil (4 %in petrolatum) was evaluated in\nthe maximization test using 25 healthy volunteers (21-44 years\nold).24The test material (4 %in petrolatum) was applied, under\nocclusion, to the volar forearm of each patient for a total of 5\nalternate-day 48-hour periods. The test site was pretreated with\n5%sodium lauryl sulfate (24-hour application, under occlu-\nsion) prior to application of the test material. A 10-day non-\ntreatment period was observed after the induction phase.\nChallenge patches were then applied, under occlusion, to new\ntest sites for 48 hours. The application of challenge patches was\npreceded by a 1-hour application of 10 %aqueous sodium\nlauryl sulfate (under occlusion). Reactions were scored at the\ntime of challenge patch removal and 24 hours later. There was\nno evidence of contact sensitization in any of the patients\ntested.\nAnthemis nobilis essential oil. In a skin irritation and sensitiza-\ntion study, anthemis nobilis essential oil (concentration not\nstated) was initially applied to 113 healthy patients (13 men,\n100 women; 18-69 years old), 110 of whom completed the\nstudy.25Three patients withdrew for reasons unrelated to con-\nduct of the study. The oil was applied, under an occlusive patch\n(volume and area not stated), between the scapulae of the upper\nback. Patches were applied to the same site on Mondays, Wed-\nnesdays, and Fridays for a total of nine 24-hour induction\napplications. Removal of patches on Tuesdays and Thursdayswas followed by a 24-hour nontreatment period. Patch removal\non Saturdays was followed by a 48-hour nontreatment period.\nReactions were scored during n ontreatment periods. The chal-\nlenge phase was initiated at the end of a 2-week nontreatment\nperiod. Challenge patches were applied to new test sites, and\nreactions were scored at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours postapplica-\ntion. At most, mild erythema was observed in 5 patients dur-\ning the induction phase. During the challenge phase, 1 patient\nhad mild erythema and edema at the 48-hour reading. This\nreaction had increased to well-defined erythema by the\n72-hour reading but had diminished to mild erythema by the\n96-hour reading. During rechallenge of this patient (semioc-\nclusive, occlusive, and open patches used), barely perceptible\nerythema was observed at 24 hours (occlusive patch test\nonly). There were no visible skin reactions at 48 or 72 hours\nfollowing application of any of the 3 types of patches. It was\nconcluded that the chamomile ( A nobilis ) essential oil tested\ndid not demonstrate a potential f or eliciting dermal irritation\nor sensitization.\nThe skin irritation and sensitization potential of anthemis\nnobilis essential oil (concentration not stated) were evaluated\nin an RIPT that initially involved 122 healthy patients (90\nwomen, 32 men; 18-68 years old), 104 of whom completed the\nstudy.26Eighteen patients withdrew for reasons unrelated to\nconduct of the study, 1 of whom withdrew due to a generalized\npetechial response on most of the back. The oil (0.2 mL) was\napplied to a 2 cm /C22 cm semiocclusive patch that was placed\non the back (between the scapulae and waist, adjacent to the\nspinal midline) of each patient. The patches remained in place\nfor 24 hours. Removal of patches on Tuesdays and Thursdays\nwas followed by a 24-hour nontreatment period. Patch removal\non Saturdays was followed by a 48-hour nontreatment period.\nReactions were scored during nontreatment periods. The test\nprocedure was repeated on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays\nfor a total of 9 induction applications. The challenge phase was\ninitiated at the end of a 2-week nontreatment period. Challenge\npatches were applied to new test sites, and reactions were\nscored at 24 and 72 hours postapplication. Transient, barely\nperceptible erythema was observed in 8 of the 104 patients\nduring induction and/or challenge phases. These reactions were\nnot classified as irritant or allergic in nature. It was concluded\nthat chamomile essential oil did not induce skin irritation or\nallergenicity.\nProvocative testing\nAnthemis nobilis extract. The sensitization potential of anthe-\nmis nobilis extract in patients sensitive to 5 %Compositae mix\n(also contains anthemis nobilis extract) in petrolatum was eval-\nuated using 76 patients. The extraction solvent was not stated.\nAnthemis nobilis extract (1 %in petrolatum) was applied to the\nback of each of 29 patients (24 women: mean age ¼56, 5 men:\nmean age ¼55) for 2 days using Finn chambers on Scanpor\ntape. Reactions were scored on days 3 to 5, and possibly, on day\n7 according to International Contact Dermatitis Research\nGroup (ICDRG) criteria. There were no positive reactions to\nanthemis nobilis extract.Jr et al 61SAnthemis nobilis. Up to 14 adult patients who had previously\ntested positive (at least a 2 þreaction) to ether extracts of C\nrecutita (2.5%in petrolatum) and/or Arnica montana (0.5%in\npetrolatum) were patch tested with A nobilis (1%in petrola-\ntum).27A patch (Finn chambers on Scanpor tape) containing\neither of the test materials was applied to the back for 2 days.\nReactions were scored on day 3, and, possibly, day 7 according\nto ICDRG recommendations. Of the 14 patients patch tested\nwith A nobilis (1%in petrolatum), 6 had reactions that were\ndescribed as follows: 2 with þþ reactions, 2 with doubtful\npositive follicular reactions, 1 with a þfollicular reaction, and\n1 with a doubtful positive reaction.\nCase Reports\nChamomile/chamomile extract. Rapid onset of a transient rash,\nburning, stinging, and itching at the application sites was\nreported for a 24-year-old woman who had applied a cosmetic\nskin mask formulation to her face.28Components of the skin\nmask were as follows: whole egg, lecithin, allantoin, aloe gel,\nMelissa extract, and chamomile extract (extraction solvent not\nstated). The genus and species of the chamomile extract were\nnot stated. Open testing (ie, without prick, scratch, or chamber)\nwith 1%chamomile extract (in physiologic saline) produced an\nextensive wheal and flare reaction on intact forearm skin. Open\ntest results were negative for the saline control and 1 %chamo-\nmile extract in 10 control patients. The authors concluded that\nthe patient appeared to have developed immunologic contact\nurticaria.\nA 20-year-old woman complained of a short-lasting cough\nand rhinitis after inhaling fragrance from a chamomile-scented\ntoilet paper.29The genus and species of the chamomile were\nnot stated. Chamomile allergenicity was evaluated in a prick\ntest and radioallergosorbent test (RAST). Results for the prick\ntest (wheal mean diameter ¼12 mm) and RAST (Pharmacia\nImmunoCAP system [CAP system]: 12.9 KU/l (non-allergenic\n¼<0.35 KU/I) were positive. Results were also positive when\nthe chamomile-scented toilet paper was evaluated in a prick-\nby-prick test (mean diameter of wheal ¼9 mm [toilet paper]\nand 5 mm [histamine]). Two atopic patients and 2 healthy\npatients served as controls for the prick-by-prick test, and\nresults were negative for the chamomile-scented tissue.\nAnthemis nobilis flower. Acute eczema on the forearms and hands\nwas observed in a 50-year-old metalworker after using a prod-\nuct for cleaning metallic items.30The patient had no personal\nor family history of atopy but had psoriasis. Treatment of the\neczema involved washing and applying compresses (over\n2-month period) with C recutita (Matricaria ) tea (from flower\nheads) and, subsequently, with a tea made from C recutita\n(Matricaria ; flower heads), A nobilis (flower heads), and mal-\nlow herbs. Patch tests were performed using Finn chambers;\nneither the area of application nor test concentration was stated.\nPositive reactions to anthemis nobilis tea ( þþon days 2 and 4)\nwere reported. Negative results were reported for 5 control\npatients tested with anthemis nobilis tea. It should be notedthat the fragrant flowering heads of both German chamomile\n(C recutita ) and Roman chamomile ( A nobilis ) are collected\nand dried for use as teas and extracts.18\nAnthemis nobilis flower oil. Severe exudative eczema of both\nnipples and areolae was observed in a 32-year-old woman who\nhad been applying an ointment (containing extracts and oil of\nA nobilis 10.5%) to treat cracked nipples.19It should be noted\nthat 2 ointments marketed under the same trade name are avail-\nable in Europe, 1 containing German chamomile (also known\nasM recutita orC recutita ) and the other containing Roman\nchamomile (also known as C nobile orA nobilis ). Patch testing\nof the ointment (Finn chambers on Scanpor tape) identified a\n3þreaction to the ointment at 2 days. A 3 þreaction was also\nobserved after patch testing with 0.1 %anthemis nobilis flower\noil in petrolatum; results were negative in 10 control patients.\nBilateral eczema of the nipples and areolae was also observed\nin a 38-year-old woman who had used the same ointment. Patch\ntesting also revealed a 3 þreaction to 0.1 %anthemis nobilis\nflower oil in petrolatum at 2 days.\nA 34-year-old woman with a history of atopic dermatitis\nwas hospitalized with acute generalized eczema, accentuated\non the face.31Prior to the onset of symptoms, the patient had\napplied compresses of chamomile tea to her face and neck.\nAdditionally, she drank chamomile tea regularly. Patch test\nresults were as follows: 25 %anthemis nobilis flower oil in\nolive oil ( þþ on day 2; þþþ on day 3) and 4 %anthemis\nnobilis flower oil in petrolatum ( þþon day 2; þþþ on day 3).\nAnthemis nobilis and anthemis nobilis extract. A 55-year-old male\nemployee of a magnet factory presented with crops of dissemi-\nnated confluent erythroderma, initially on sun-exposed areas\n(face, neck, V of neck and acral) and then spreading to the\nremainder of the skin.32The lesions were described as itchy\nand scaly. The patient experienced exacerbation of these reac-\ntions after visiting an area where there were many and varied\nplants, even though there was no direct contact with the plants.\nPatch testing with the A nobilis plant as is yielded a þþþ\nreaction on days 2 and 4. The same reactions were reported\nafter patch testing with A nobilis ethyl ether extracts (stem and\nleaves). Photopatch testing (Finn chambers, ultraviolet A\n[UVA] exposure) also yielded a þþþ reaction to the plant as\nis and its ethyl ether extracts.\nPhototoxicity\nAnthemis nobilis flower oil. The phototoxicity of anthemis nobilis\nflower oil was evaluated using 12 Skh-1: hairless mice and 2\nminiature swine.33The light source was a 6-kW long-arc xenon\nhigh-pressure burner (UVA and UVB proportions approxi-\nmated those found in mid-latitude summer sun spectrum) or\na bank of 4 fluorescent F40BL black light lamps (UVA region,\ncentered over 350 nm). The 12 mice and 2 swine were treated\nwith the nonviscous oil, tested as received. A single application\nof the oil (20 mL) was made to an area of the back that was\napproximately 2 cm2. Six mice and 1 swine were then exposed62S International Journal of Toxicology 36(Supplement 1)to one of the light sources, and, the remaining 6 mice and 1\nswine, to the other light source at 30 minutes postapplication of\nthe oil. The duration of exposure to the fluorescent blacklight\nsource was 1 hour (integrated UVA intensity ¼3W / m2), and\n40 minutes (intensity of weighted erythemal energy ¼0.1667\nW/m2) to the xenon lamp. If application of the oil elicited a\nresponse from skin exposure to the blacklight lamp or elicited\nmore than a barely perceptible response to the xenon lamp, the\noil was considered phototoxic. The area of skin treated with the\noil, but not irradiated, served as the control for primary irritant\nreactions. One group of control mice was treated with 8-\nmethoxypsoralen (8-MOP; 0.01 %in methanol) and another\ngroup with appropriate vehicle only. Exposure to the xenon\nlamp caused barely perceptible erythema in animals pretreated\nwith vehicle only or with anthemis nobilis flower oil. Parallel\nresults were obtained using the blacklight lamp. The 8-MOP\nwas phototoxic.\nReproductive and Developmental Toxicity\nChamomile\nA case–control analysis of data from the Quebec pregnancy\nregistry was performed. Data on 3183 pregnant females were\ncollected, and multivariate l ogistic regression models were\nused for data analysis.34Cases were defined as women who\ndelivered a newborn (<2500 g), and 424 of the 3183 partici-\npants were classified as cases. After adjusting for potential\nconfounders, there were no statistically significant associations\nfound between the use of chamomile ( A nobilis ) tea (alone or in\ncombination with other herbal products) during the last 2 tri-\nmesters of pregnancy and the incidence of low birth weight.\nAn epidemiology study examined the use of herbal products\nby pregnant women in Italy and pregnancy outcome.35The\nnumber of individuals (mostly between 31 and 40 years old)\ninterviewed was 392. Of the 392 individuals, 109 reported\nhaving taken 1 or more herbal products during pregnancy; the\nremaining 283 were classified as nonusers. The most frequently\nused herb was chamomile (48; 44 %of the 109 patients), fol-\nlowed by licorice (15; 13.8 %of the 109 patients). For the 37\nregular users of chamomile and 14 regular users of licorice,\nthere was a higher frequency of threatening miscarriages\n(21.6%and 35.7 %, respectively) and preterm labors (21.6 %\nand 16.7 %, respectively) when compared to nonusers. Whether\nthe frequency of threatening miscarriages in users of chamo-\nmile versus nonusers was stat istically significant was not\nstated. An unspecified cardiac malformation (thought to have\nbeen related to Down syndrome) and an enlarged kidney were\ndiagnosed in 2 neonates, following regular maternal consump-\ntion of chamomile. Regarding pregnancy outcome in the study\npopulation, no statistically significant differences were evident\nbetween users and nonusers, except for a higher incidence of\nnewborns small for gestational age (11.9 %vs 5.3%;P¼.039).\nHowever, after further analysis of the data, it was hypothesized\nthat the regular intake of 2 herbs (chamomile and licorice,\ntaken from the beginning of pregnancy) may have had aninfluence on threatening miscarriages and preterm labors of\nlow birth weight infants.\nGenotoxicity\nAnthemis Nobilis Flower Oil\nThe genotoxicity of anthemis nobilis flower oil was evaluated\nin the rec-assay using Bacillus subtilis strains PB 1652 and PB\n1791 and in the Salmonella /microsome reversion assay using\nSalmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, and\nTA1537.36In the rec-assay, 10 to 30 mL of the oil was applied\nto a sterile filter paper disk (9-mm diameter), placed on the\nsurface of nutrient agar plates seeded with the tester strains.\nFollowing incubation, the diameter of the inhibition zones\nformed around the disk was measured. Methyl methanesulfo-\nnate, mitomycin C, and Adriamycin served as positive controls.\nAmpicillin and chloramphenicol served as negative controls.\nPositive DNA damaging activity was assumed if the ratio\nbetween the diameter of the inhibition zone of the rec/C0mutant\nand that of the parental recþstrain exceeded a value of 1.2.\nAnthemis nobilis flower oil did not produce positive DNA\ndamaging activity in either B subtilis strain. All positive con-\ntrols had positive DNA damaging activity, whereas the 2 neg-\native controls did not. In the Salmonella /microsome reversion\nassay (with and without metabolic activation), the oil (in\nDimethyl Sulfoxide) was evaluated at doses up to 1 mL/plate\nand was not found to be genotoxic.\nCarcinogenicity\nCarcinogenicity studies on the A nobilis –derived ingredients\nreviewed in this safety assessment were not found in the pub-\nlished literature nor were unpublished studies provided.\nBiological Activity\nAnti-Inflammatory Activity\nAnthemis nobilis flower oil. The anti-inflammatory activity of\nanthemis nobilis flower oil was evaluated using groups of 6\nadult male Wistar rats.37The oil from 2 varieties of A nobilis\nthat have been cultivated in Italy under the names “white-head-\ned” or “double-flowered roman chamomile” and “yellow-\nheaded roman chamomile” was tested. The oil from each\nflower type was administered intraperitoneally (IP) at a dose\nof 350 mg/kg, and the animals were then dosed orally (gavage)\nwith 5 mL water. Of the 2 control groups, 1 was injected IP\nwith normal saline (dose not stated) and the other with indo-\nmethacin (14 mmol/kg). The dosing of control animals IP was\nfollowed by oral dosing with water. At 30 minutes posttreat-\nment, the right hind paw was injected with 0.1 mL of a 1 %\nsuspension of carrageenan in normal saline to induce phlogosis.\nEach oil caused a considerable anti-inflammatory effect, par-\nticularly by 3 hours postinjection. The oils caused 22.8 %to\n38.7%inhibition of the carrageenan-induced increase in paw\nvolume. Indomethacin caused 73.7 %inhibition.Jr et al 63SSummary\nThe safety of Roman chamomile ( A nobilis ) ingredients is\nreviewed in this safety assessment. These ingredients function\nmostly as fragrance ingredients and skin-conditioning agents in\ncosmetic products. The VCRP and Council survey data com-\nbined indicate that the following 3 chamomile ingredients have\nbeen used in cosmetic products: anthemis nobilis flower\nextract, anthemis nobilis flower oil, and anthemis nobilis\nflower water. Of the 3 ingredients, the highest ingredient use\nconcentration has been reported as 10 %for anthemis nobilis\nflower water in a skin cleansing product.\nAnthemis nobilis flower oil is produced by the steam dis-\ntillation of A nobilis flowers. A UV spectral analysis for this oil\nindicated an absorption maximum of *225 nm.\nAnthemis nobilis flower oil did not induce acute toxicity\nwhen administered orally to rats. A trade name mixture asso-\nciated with anthemis nobilis flower extract (propylene glycol\n[and] water [and] anthemis nobilis flower extract) was classi-\nfied as a very slight ocular irritant in rabbits. The mixture\ncontained 5 %to 9.9%anthemis nobilis flower extract and was\ntested as a 20 %(vol/vol) solution in distilled water.\nAnthemis nobilis flower oil was classified as nonirritating to\nthe skin of hairless mice and irritating to the skin of rabbits. A\ntrade name mixture associated with anthemis nobilis flower\nextract (propylene glycol [and] water [and] anthemis nobilis\nflower extract) was also nonirritating to the skin of rabbits. The\nmixture contained 5 %to 9.9%anthemis nobilis flower extract\nand was tested as a 20 %(vol/vol) solution in distilled water.\nAnthemis nobilis flower oil (4 %) did not induce skin sensi-\ntization in guinea pigs. In a human predictive patch test, anthe-\nmis nobilis flower oil (4 %) was not a skin irritant in patients\ntested or skin sensitizer in a maximization test involving 25\npatients. In 2 other human repeated insult patch tests, anthemis\nnobilis essential oil did not induce skin irritation or sensitiza-\ntion in 110 and 104 patients, respectively. A skin care lotion\ncontaining 3 %anthemis nobilis flower did not demonstrate a\npotential for eliciting dermal i rritation or sensitization in a\npredictive HRIPT.\nResults were negative in 29 patients patch tested with anthe-\nmis nobilis extract (1 %in petrolatum). Provocative patch test\nreactions to A nobilis (plant part(s) not specified; 1 %in petro-\nlatum) were described as þþreactions (2 of 14 patients) and\ndoubtful positive follicular reactions (2 patients). Positive reac-\ntions to A nobilis ingredients were also observed in a number of\ncase reports.\nBarely perceptible erythema was observed in hairless mice\nand miniature swine treated with anthemis nobilis flower oil\n(20mL/cm2) in a phototoxicity study, and these results were\nclassified as negative.\nIn a case–control study (424 cases), there were no statisti-\ncally significant associations found between the use of chamo-\nmile tea (alone or in combination with other herbal products)\nduring the last 2 trimesters of pregnancy and the risk of low\nbirth weight. For 37 regular users of chamomile (herbal prod-\nuct, genus and species not stated), both frequency ofthreatening miscarriages and frequency preterm labors were\n21.6%higher when compared to nonusers (group of 283);\nmany of the patients also consumed licorice.\nAnthemis nobilis flower oil was not genotoxic in the rec-\nassay (no positive DNA damaging activity) or Ames test.\nCarcinogenicity data on chamomile ingredients were not\nfound in the published literature. The anti-inflammatory\nactivity of anthemis nobilis flower oil has been demonstrated\nin rats dosed IP.\nDiscussion\nComposition data are available on anthemis nobilis flower oil,\nas well as samples of the whole plant and the flower of A\nnobilis . The Panel agreed that these data are adequate to\nsupport assumptions about the likely compositions of other\nA nobilis –derived ingredients.\nAs botanical ingredients, derived from natural plant sources,\nare complex mixtures, the Panel expressed concern that multi-\nple botanical ingredients may each contribute to the final con-\ncentration of a single constituent. Therefore, when formulating\nproducts, manufacturers should avoid reaching levels of plant\nconstituents that may cause se nsitization or other adverse\neffects. In particular, the Panel was concerned that cosmetics\ncontaining these ingredients may contain potentially sensitiz-\ning levels of constituents, such as sesquiterpene lactones. The\nlevels of these constituents can vary widely in cosmetic ingre-\ndients, depending on the growing conditions of the plant, the\nmethod of manufacturing of the ingredient, and other factors,\nand the reported results of the sensitization tests may not rep-\nresent the complete spectrum of likely levels in cosmetic ingre-\ndients. Thus, the Panel concluded that cosmetics containing\nthese ingredients should be formulated to be nonsensitizing.\nThe Panel expressed concern about pesticide residues and\nheavy metals that may be present in A nobilis –derived ingre-\ndients. They stressed that the cosmetics industry should con-\ntinue to use current good manuf acturing practices to limit\nimpurities in the ingredient before blending into cosmetic\nformulations.\nThe Panel noted that the highest use concentration reported\nforA nobilis –derived ingredients reviewed in this safety assess-\nment is 10 %anthemis nobilis flower water. Because use at this\nconcentration was reported only for a single skin cleansing\nproduct in a survey of ingredient use concentrations, the Panel\nagreed that use at a concentration of 10 %is not representative\nof typical use concentrations. Thus, the Panel determined that\nthe negative HRIPT data on a product containing 3 %anthemis\nnobilis flower extract are sufficient, together with other skin\nirritation and sensitization data in this safety assessment, for\nevaluating the skin irritation and sensitization potential of A\nnobilis –derived ingredients over the range of reported use con-\ncentrations. Although mammalian genotoxicity and carcino-\ngenicity data were not available, the negative bacterial\ngenotoxicity data, the available chemical composition data on\nthese botanical ingredients, and the low use concentrations64S International Journal of Toxicology 36(Supplement 1)suggest that systemic toxicity would not be likely if percuta-\nneous absorption of any of the constituents were to occur.\nThe Panel discussed incidental inhalation exposure from\naerosol and pump hair sprays and foot powders and sprays.\nInhalation toxicity data were not available. However, the Panel\nconsidered pertinent data indicating that incidental inhalation\nexposures to these ingredients in such cosmetic products would\nnot cause adverse health effects, including data characterizing\nthe potential for these ingredients to cause acute oral toxicity,\nand ocular or dermal irritation, or sensitization. The Panel\nnoted that 95 %to 99%of droplets/particles produced in cos-\nmetic aerosols would not be respirable to any appreciable\namount. Coupled with the small actual exposure in the breath-\ning zone and the concentrations at which the ingredients are\nused, the available information indicates that incidental inhala-\ntion would not be a significant route of exposure that might\nlead to local respiratory or systemic effects. A detailed discus-\nsion and summary of the Panel’s approach to evaluating inci-\ndental inhalation exposures to ingredients in cosmetic products\nare available at http://www.cir-safety.org/cir-findings.\nConclusion\nThe CIR Expert Panel concluded that the following cosmetic\ningredients are safe in the present practices of use and concen-\ntration in cosmetics, described in this safety assessment, when\nformulated to be nonsensitizing:\n/C15anthemis nobilis flower oil\n/C15anthemis nobilis flower water\n/C15anthemis nobilis flower extract\n/C15anthemis nobilis flower powder*\nwhere ingredients in this group not in current use to be used in\nthe future (indicated by *), the expectation is that they would be\nused in product categories and at concentrations comparable to\nothers in the group.\nAuthors’ Note\nUnpublished sources cited in this report are available from the Direc-\ntor, Cosmetic Ingredient Revi ew, 1620L Street, NW, Suite 1200,\nWashington, DC 20036, USA.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interests\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to\nthe research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for\nthe research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The articles\nin this supplement were sponsored by the Cosmetic Ingredient\nReview.

The safety of a-amino acids as direct food additives has been well established, based\non extensive research through acute and chronic dietary exposures and the Panel previously has reviewed the safety of individual\na-amino acids in cosmetics. The Panel focused its review on dermal irritation and sensitization data relevant to the use of these\ningredients in topical cosmetics. The Panel concluded that these 21 ingredients are safe in the present practices of use and\nconcentration as used in cosmetics.\nKeywords\namino acids, safety, cosmetics\nIntroduction\nThis safety assessment covers 21 ingredients, each of which is a\nmixture of amino acids derived from specific animal and plant\nsources. These ingredients function as skin and hair condition-\ning agents in personal care products. The full list of ingredients\nin this report is found in Table 1.\nA concurrent review of the safety of hydrolyzed proteins\nfrom animal and plant sources is being performed by the Cos-\nmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) Expert Panel. The Expert Panel\npreviously has reviewed the safety of individual a-amino acids\nand concluded that these ingredients are safe for use in cos-\nmetic ingredients.1\nChemistry\nThe ingredients in this group are related because they are each\nprepared from proteins by complete hydrolysis to yield amino\nacid mixtures (Figure 1). The most frequently used method for\nhydrolyzing proteins to amino acids appears to be heating to at\nleast 110/C14C with concentrated hydrochloric acid.2,3However,\nsome amino acids, including tryptophan, are readily destroyed\nor are only partially hydrolyzed by hydrochloric acid. For these\namino acids, alternate hydrolysis agents, like sulfonic acids, are\nused in place of hydrochloric acid, or alkaline hydrolysis is\nperformed.3-5While these amino acids are produced from pro-\nteins, the hydrolysis process commonly racemizes the amino\nacids and the end product is not primarily in the L-form of the\nstereoisomers but is a mixture of L- and D-forms.The composition of amino acids may be analyzed by chro-\nmatographic separation, such as separation with liquid–liquid\nchromatography ion-exchange columns, and detection, such as\ndetection via mass spectrometry, of the residues after adequate\nhydrolysis of the substrate.2,3\nMethod of Manufacturing\nAs noted previously, most methods utilized acid hydrolysis at\nelevated temperatures to hydrolyze proteins to their constituent\namino acids. However, one supplier has reported that Lycium\nbarbarum (wolfberry) amino acids are derived from the L bar-\nbarum fruit.6The fruit is autolyzed in water to free the cyto-\nplasmic proteins. The prote ins are then hydrolyzed with\nproprietary protease enzymes. The hydrolysis breaks down the\nfruit proteins into basic amino acid constituents that are water\nsoluble. The product is then purified by filtration and spray-\ndried to obtain a powdered mixture.\n1Cosmetic Ingredient Review Scient ific Analyst/Writer, Washington,\nDC, USA\n2Cosmetic Ingredient Review Chemist, Washington, DC, USA\n3Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel Member, Washington, DC, USA\n4Former Director, Cosmetic Ingredient Review, Washington, DC, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nLillian Gill, Cosmetic Ingredient Review, 1620 L Street, NW, 12th Floor,\nWashington, DC 20036, USA.\nEmail: cirinfo@cir-safety.orgInternational Journal of Toxicology\n2014, Vol. 33(Supplement 4) 5S-12S\nªThe Author(s) 2014\nReprints and permission:\nsagepub.com/journalsPermissions.nav\nDOI: 10.1177/1091581814554774\nijt.sagepub.com\nAnother supplier reported that amino acids from keratin,\nlupine, oat, rice, silk, and wh eat proteins are manufactured\nby enzymatic hydrolysis for a specific duration of time and\nat an elevated temperature (details not provided).7Impurities\nSeveral of the ingredients of this safety assessment, including\ncollagen amino acids and elastin amino acids, may be bovine\nsourced.

A supplier has\nprovided the composition data on amino acids from L bar-\nbarum and wheat proteins (see Table 2).6,7No composition\ndata were discovered for the remaining animal- and plant-\nderived amino acid ingredients.Use\nCosmetic\nThe animal- and plant-derived amino acids in this safety\nassessment function primarily as hair conditioning and skin\nconditioning agents in cosmetic formulations.8These functions\nare similar to those of the a-amino acid ingredients.1\nTable 3 presents the current product formulation data for\nanimal- and plant-derived amino acids. According to informa-\ntion supplied to the FDA by industry as part of the Voluntary\nCosmetic Registration Program, silk amino acids have the most\nreported uses in cosmetic and personal care products, with a\ntotal of 328; approximately half of those uses are in noncolor-\ning hair products.9Wheat amino acids have the second greatest\nnumber of overall uses reported, with a total of 251; again,\napproximately half of those uses are in noncoloring hair prod-\nucts. The reported product categories of the animal- and plant-\nderived amino acid ingredients are comparable to those of the\na-amino acid ingredients.1\nIn a recent survey of use concentrations by the Personal Care\nProducts Council, silk amino acids had a maximum use\nconcentration range of 8.0 /C210/C05%to 0.2%, with the 0.2 %\nreported in shampoos and other personal cleanliness prod-\nucts.10Wheat amino acids had a maximum use concentration\nrange of 1.0 /C210/C04%to 0.3%, with 0.3 %reported in hair dyes.\nThe use concentrations of the animal- and plant-derived amino\nacid ingredients are similar, if not lower in some cases, to those\nof the a-amino acid ingredients.1Those ingredients with no\nreported uses or use concentrations are listed in Table 4.\nSeveral of the amino acids sourced from animals and plants\ndescribed in this report are used in cosmetic sprays, including\naerosol and pump hair and body spray products, and could\nFigure 1.

While the expectation is that most animal- and plant-\nderived amino acids will be produced by acid hydrolysis ofproteins from the relevant source, enzymatic cleavage has been\nreported to be used.\nOf the animal- and plant-derived amino acids, amino acids\nfrom silk have the most reported uses in cosmetic and personal\ncare products, with a total of 328; the maximum use concen-\ntration range was reported to be 8.0 /C210/C05%to 0.2%. The\nreported functions, product categories, and use concentrations\nof the animal- and plant-derived amino acid ingredients were\ncomparable to those of the a-amino acid ingredients.\nMany of the proteins that serve as the sources of the amino\nacids that are described in this safety assessment are found in\nthe foods consumed daily. Toxicities from dermal exposure\nwould not be expected to be different from oral exposures and,\nas such, are not concerning to the CIR Expert Panel. Irritation\nand sensitization are of concern and are the focus in this report.\nData from the previous safety assessment on a-amino acids\nsupport that these ingredients would not likely be irritants or\nsensitizers. Additionally, nonhuman in vitro dermal and ocular\nirritation studies determined that amino acids derived from\nkeratin, lupine, oat, rice, silk, and wheat sources were not\nirritants.\nDiscussion\nThe Panel acknowledged that the safety of a-amino acids as\ndirect food additives has been well supported based on exten-\nsive research through acute and chronic dietary exposures. The\nPanel determined that this body of research, coupled with the\navailable irritation and sensitization data and use concentra-\ntions much lower than those consumed daily in the diet, pro-\nvides a sufficient basis for determining the safety of amino\nacids in cosmetic products.Table 6.

However, the Panel concluded that the concentra-\ntions of these amino acids in cosmetic products are low, and\nwould not be conducive to significant absorption through der-\nmal application or incidental ingestion, and thus, would not\ncause systemic reactions in individuals.\nWhile the International Cosmetic Dictionary and Hand-\nbook does not distinguish among the a-amino acids used in\ncosmetics that are L-stereoisomers from those that are D-\nstereoisomers (or are mixtures of L-a n d D-stereoisomers), the\nPanel noted that the L-amino acids are generally recognized as\nsafe (GRAS) direct food additives by the FDA (except\nmethionine, which is GRAS as a racemic mixture, and gly-\ncine, which is GRAS and has no stereocenter). Amino acids\nwith a mixture of the 2 stereoisomers ( DL-) have approved\nuses as food additives according to the USP Food Chemicals\nCodex. This safety assessment report addresses D-a n d L-\nstereoisomers of the amino acids derived from animal and\nplant sources. The Panel does not anticipate that there are\nsignificant toxicological diffe rences in cosme tic applications\namong the stereoisomers.\nThe Panel discussed the issue of incidental inhalation expo-\nsure from hair sprays, body and hand sprays, aftershave lotion\nsprays, and suntan sprays. No inhalation data were available.\nThese ingredients reportedly are used at concentrations up to\n0.02%in cosmetic products that may be aerosolized. The Panel\nnoted that 95 %to 99%of droplets/particles would not be\nrespirable to any appreciable amount. Coupled with the small\nactual exposure in the breathing zone and the concentrations at\nwhich the ingredients are used, the available information indi-\ncates that incidental inhalation would not be a significant route\nof exposure that might lead to local respiratory or systemic\ntoxic effects. The Panel considered other data available to\ncharacterize the potential for animal- and plant-derived amino\nacids to cause systemic toxicity, irritation, sensitization, or\nother effects. They noted that numerous studies and reviews\nhave been published in the literature regarding the safety of\ndietary exposure to amino acids, including studies on oral acute\nand chronic toxicity, carcinogenicity, and genotoxicity, which\nfound no safety concerns for these substances in the amounts at\nwhich they are consumed in flavoring agents. Additionally,\nlittle or no irritation was observed in multiple tests of dermal\nand ocular exposure. A detailed discussion and summary of the\nPanel’s approach to evaluating incidental inhalation exposures\nto ingredients in cosmetic pr oducts is available at http://\nwww.cir-safety.org/cir-findings.\nThe Panel expressed concern about the dangers inherent in\nusing animal-derived ingredients, namely the transmission of\ninfectious agents. They stressed that these ingredients must be\nfree of detectible pathogenic viruses or infectious agents (eg,\nbovine spongiform encephalopathy). These ingredients should\nbe produced according to current good manufacturing practices\nand should conform to regulations for producing substances\nfrom animal-derived materials.The Panel also expressed concern regarding pesticide resi-\ndues and heavy metals that may be present in botanical ingre-\ndients. Because the plant proteins from which plant-derived\namino acids are produced are extensively processed, it is\nunlikely that these impurities would remain.\nThe Panel noted the uncertainty regarding method of man-\nufacturing. The Panel considered that vigorous acid hydrolysis\nwould yield amino acids with little or no residual peptides,\nbecause such acid hydrolysis attacks all the peptide bonds in\na protein in a nonpreferential manner. The Panel was concerned\nthat enzymatic hydrolysis may fail to completely hydrolyze the\nsource proteins and, thus, may produce di-, tri-, or other pep-\ntides, as well as amino acids. Such residual peptide impurities\nmay have the potential to cause allergic reactions in sensitive\nindividuals. Further input on the usual methods used to produce\namino acids from animal and plant proteins would be useful. If\nthe methodology involves rigorous acid hydrolysis, there is less\nconcern that residual small peptides will be present. In the\nabsence of further clarification, the Panel stated that industry\nshould manufacture animal- and plant-derived amino acids in a\nway that ensures that no residual peptides remain.\nConclusion\nThe CIR Expert Panel concluded that the animal- and plant-\nderived amino acids listed are safe in the present practices of\nuse and concentration in cosmetics. The 21 ingredients\nincluded in this safety assessment are as follows:\napricot kernel amino acids*\ncollagen amino acids\ncorn gluten amino acids*\nelastin amino acids*\nGarcinia mangostana amino acids*\nhair keratin amino acids\njojoba amino acids*\nkeratin amino acids\nlupine amino acids\nL barbarum amino acids*\nmilk amino acids\noat amino acids\nrice amino acids\nsesame amino acids*\nsilk amino acids\nsoy amino acids\nSpirulina amino acids*\nsweet almond amino acids*\nvegetable amino acids\nwheat amino acids\nyeast amino acids*\n*Not reported to be in current use.

{"id": 14, "text": "JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF TOXICOLOGY \nVolume 12, Number 5,1993 \nMary Ann Liebwt, Inc., Publishers \nFinal Report on the Safety Assessment of \nArachidonic Acid \nABSTRACT \nArachidonic Acid is an essential, polyunsaturated, fatty acid that is used as a \nsurfactant-cleansing agent and a surfactant-emulsifying agent in cosmetic formula- \ntions. Arachidonic Acid is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and the \ncirculatory system; it distributes rapidly into the lipid compartment of the body and is \nrapidly converted to phospholipid by the liver. \nArachidonic Acid may alter the cutaneous immune response; in one study, the \neffect was more pronounced at lower test concentrations than at higher. Application \nof Arachidonic Acid to mouse skin produced edema and inflammation, with high \ndosages possibly causing ulceration of the skin. Arachidonic Acid has mutagenic \npotential. In a 24 h single insult patch test, a formulation containing 0.04% Arachi- \ndonic Acid was not a skin irritant. \nThe safety of use of this ingredient in cosmetic products has not been documented \nand substantiated. It cannot be concluded that Arachidonic Acid is safe for use in \ncosmetic products until the needed additional safety test data have been obtained and \nevaluated. If the requested skin absorption data indicate that absorption occurs, \n: immunomodulatory data, carcinogenicity and photocarcinogenicity data, human \nirritation, sensitization, and photosensitization data may also be required. \nINTRODUCTION \nA RACHIDONIC ACID IS A POLYUNSATURATED FATTY acid with a hydrocarbon chain \nconsisting of 20 carbons, four nonconjugated double bonds, and a terminal \ncarboxyl group. It is used as a surfactant-cleansing agent, which includes the soap form \nof Arachidonic Acid, and as a surfactant-emulsifying agent (Nikitakis, 1988). \nThe data base for Arachidonic Acid is large. Additional data not included in this \nreview are contained in the Appendix to this report. \nCHEMISTRY \nDefinition and Structure \nArachidonic Acid (CAS No. 506-32-l) is the polyunsaturated fatty acid (Estrin etal., \n1982) that conforms to the formula (Windholz, 1983): \n481 482 COSMETIC INGREDIENT REVIEW \nFatty acids whose structures contain multiple double bonds, such as Arachidonic \nAcid, are kinked and relatively rigid in comparison to saturated fatty acids (Lehninger, \n1982). \nArachidonic Acid is also known as 5,8,11,14-Eicosatetraenoic Acid (Estrin et al., \n1982; Windholz, 1983), (all-Z)-5,8,11,14-Eicosatetraenoic Acid (Sweet, 1987; Osol, \n1980), and Eicosa-5:8:11 :14-tetraenoic Acid (West and Todd, 1961). Collectively, \nArachidonic Acid, linoleic acid, and linolenic acid have been called Vitamin F (Rossoff, \n1974); these acids are known as the essential fatty acids. \nProperties \nArachidonic Acid is a liquid at room temperature (Windholz, 1983; Hawley, \n1971); unsaturated fatty acids are oily liquids at body temperature (Lehninger, 1982). \nArachidonic Acid has a melting point of -49.5”C (Weast, 1982; Hawley, 1971) and \ndecomposes before reaching a boiling point (Weast, 1982). Arachidonic Acid absorbs \nat 257 nm (E 12,303), 268 nm (E 16,218), and 315 nm (E 6607) (Grasselli, 1973). \nPhysical and chemical properties of Arachidonic Acid are summarized in Table 1. \nTABLE 1.

Arachidonic Acid occurs in the brain, \nglandular organs, and depot fats of animals; it occurs in small amounts in human depot \nfats (Windholz, 1983; Osol, 1980). Arachidonic Acid is also found in lecithin \n(phosphatidylcholine) (Hawley, 1971) and is a constituent of animal phosphatides \n(Windholz, 1983); it is a major component (15%) of the mixed fatty acids of adrenal \ngland phosphatides (Swern, 1979). \nManufacture and Production \nArachidonic Acid has been synthesized from acetylenic intermediates (Ege et al., \n1961; Rachlin et al., 1961). Ege et al. (1961) described the synthesis of Arachidonic \nAcid from 1 -heptyne and Rachlin et al. (1961) described the synthesis of Arachidonic \nAcid from 2-propargyloxytetrahydropyran. \nPure Arachidonic Acid, in the form of its methyl ester, can be isolated in limited \namounts from animal lipids; however, this method is not practical for producing large \namounts of Arachidonic Acid (Rachlin et al., 1961). \nAnalytical Methods \nArachidonic Acid can be determined via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry \n(CC-MS) (Bennett et al., 1987), gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) (Chandler and Giri, \n1981), gas--liquid radiochromatography (Swell and Law, 1967), radio gas chromatog- \nraphy (Nakazawa et al., 1976), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) \n(Audera et al., 1988; Voelkel et al., 1980), radioimmunoassay (Voelkel et al., 1980), \nradio-HPLC (Robinson et al., 1989), thin layer chromatography (TLC) (Wang et al., \n1989), TLUautoradiography (Shirazi et al ., 1989), and by an isomerization procedure \n(Swern, 1979). \nA capillary GLC method has been developed that provides an accurate, precise, \nand reliable means for the quantitative determination of Arachidonic Acid in suspen- \nsions of washed erythrocytic membranes (Taylor et al., 1987). \nUSE \nCosmetic \nThe product formulation data submitted to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) \nin 1992 stated that Arachidonic Acid was contained in 29 cosmetic product formula- \ntions (Table 2). Arachidonic Acid was used in face, body, and hand skin care \npreparations (excluding shaving preparations), moisturizing skin care preparations, \nnight skin care preparations, wrinkle smoothers (removers), and other skin care \npreparations. The greatest reported use of Arachidonic Acid was in other skin care \npreparations: 1 1 formulations. \nConcentration of use values are no longer reported to the FDA by the cosmetics \nindustry (Federal Register, 1992). However, product formulation data submitted to the \nFDA stated that Arachidonic Acid was used in skin care preparations at a concentration \nof <5% (FDA, 1989). 484 COSMETIC INGREDIENT REVIEW \nTABLE 2.

It \nhas been recommended for use with other fatty acids in treatment of infant eczema and \ndermatitis (0~01, 1980). Arachidonic Acid is used, often with linoleic and linolenic \nacids, in the prevention and treatment of eczema and dermatitis in animals, particularly \ndogs, cats, and swine (Windholz, 1983; Rossoff, 1974). \nBIOLOGY \nDetailed biology information on Arachidonic Acid is contained in the Appendix to \nthis report. \nGeneral \nArachidonic Acid is a polyunsaturated fatty acid that can be synthesized metabol- \nically from linoleic acid (Lehninger, 1982); however, linoleic acid cannot be synthe- \nsized by mammals and must be obtained from plant sources. Fatty acids required in the \ndiet are called essential fatty acids (EFAs). \nThe conversion of linoleic acid into Arachidonic Acid involves the desaturation of \nlinoleic acid, as linoleyl-CoA, to y-linolenic acid (y-linolenyl-CoA), which is then \nelongated by the addition of a 2-carbon unit from malonyl-CoA to form dihomo-y- \nlinolenyl-CoA. Dihomo-y-linolenyl-CoA is then desaturated at carbon 5 and 6 to form \nArachidonic Acid, as arachidonyl-CoA. \nArachidonic Acid is a normal constituent of cells and is mainly found in membrane- \nbound phospholipids (Samuelsson, 1987). The concentration of Arachidonic Acid in \nmost cells is normally less than 1 OP6M (Morrison, 1986). Arachidonic Acid is released \nfrom membrane phospholipids primarily by the action of phospholipase A, and \nphospholipase C (Zoja et al., 1989). \nAbsorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion \nDermal absorption studies for Arachidonic Acid have not been reported. \nArachidonic Acid is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract (Coots, 1965; \nChow and Hollander, 1978; Ramesha et al., 1985) and the circulatory system (de SAFETY ASSESSMENT OF ARACHIDONIC ACID 485 \nTomas and Mercuri, 1971; Puri et al., 1975; Zijlstra and Vincent, 1985). Arachidonic \nAcid distributes rapidly into the lipid compartment of the body (Zijlstra and Vincent, \n1985) and is rapidly converted to phospholipid by the liver (de Tomas and Mercuri, \n1971). Direct release is catalyzed by phospholipase A,. Phospholipase C first forms a \ndiglyceride that yields free Arachidonic Acid by hydrolyzation. Cyclooxygenase and \nIipoxygenase facilitate hydrogen removal, double-bond rearrangement, and inclusion \nof oxygen to yield several unstable fatty acids (McGiff, 1987). The rate-limiting step of \nArachidonic Acid metabolite formation is the release of free Arachidonic Acid from the \nphospholipid (Malmsten, 1986). \nArachidonic Acid can be metabolized by three different pathways (McGiff, 1987). \nIf oxygenation occurs via the cyclooxygenase pathway, prostaglandins E,, Fza, 12, and \n4, V’GL PGF,,, PGI,, and PGD,), and thromboxane A, (TxA,) are formed (Zoja \net al., 1989). If oxygenation occurs through the Iipoxygenase pathway, hydroxy fatty \nacids and leukotrienes are formed. \nThe third pathway for the metabolism of Arachidonic Acid in animal tissues is by the \ncytochrome P450 system (Schwartzman et al., 1987), which is called the epoxygenase \npathway (Basu and Karmazyn, 1987). Cytochrome P450-dependent monoxygenase \nconverts Arachidonic Acid to monohydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, epoxyico- \nsatetrienoic acid, and the o,w-1, and o-2 hydroxylation products (Schwartzman et al., \n1987). The formation of these metabolites is strictly dependent on molecular oxygen \nand NADPH (McGiff, 1987; Schwartzman et al., 1987). \nIron, or heme, is an essential cofactor for the cyclooxygenase, Iipoxygenase, and \nperoxidase enzymes involved in the formation of platelet endoperoxides and throm- \nboxanes (Rao et al., 1978). For the oxidation of Arachidonic Acid, iron must be in the \nferrous form, and the reaction between Arachidonic Acid and iron is dependent on the \npresence of oxygen. \nArachidonic Acid and Inflammation \nlism Arachidonic Acid metabolites are involved in the inflammatory process. Metabo- \nof Arachidonic Acid via the cyclooxygenase pathway produces the metabolites \nPGI, and PGE,, which can be vasodilators (Zoja et al., 1989), and the prostaglandin \nendoperoxidases, G, and H,, and TxA,, which induce rapid irreversible aggregation of \nhuman platelets and are inhibitors of smooth muscle contraction (Malmsten, 1986). \nTxA, is a potent vasoconstrictor (Zoja et al., 1989). \nMetabolism of Arachidonic Acid occurs by the Iipoxygenase pathway in cells \ninvolved in host inflammatory responses; these cells include human neutrophil \npolymorphonuclear leukocytes, eosinophils, monocytes, alveolar macrophages, and \nmast cells (Lee et al., 1984). Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) and leukotriene B, \nare products of the Iipoxygenase pathway of Arachidonic Acid metabolism that have \nchemotactic and chemokinetic activity; leukotriene B, is the most active compound \nderived from Arachidonic Acid for chemotactic effects on polymorphonuclear leuko- \ncytes (Malmsten, 1986). \nIn vivo, the inflammatory response appears to begin with adherence of leukocytes \nto the endothelium of microvessels near inflammatory areas. In vitro, it seems to \ncorrespond to leukocyte aggregation and adherence. Leukotrienes C, and D,, also \nproducts of the Iipoxygenase pathway, induce a contractile response to decrease the \nsurface area of isolated glomeruli and cause shape changes in cultured mesangial cells \n(Zoja et al., 1989). Leukotrienes C,, D,, and E, do not induce chemotaxis, enzyme 486 COSMETIC INGREDIENT REVIEW \nrelease, or leukocyte aggregation, but do have a potent effect on smooth muscle in the \nperipheral airways and the ability to increase permeability in venules to macromole- \ncules (Malmsten, 1986). \nArachidonic Acid and Major Diseases \nA chronic cellular imbalance between Arachidonic Acid, y-linolenic acid, and \neicosapentaenoic acid, and of their respective eicosanoid derivatives, may have major \nhealth implications (Booyens and van der Merwe, 1985). Such an imbalance may be \ninvolved in diseases such as atherosclerotic heart disease, arterial hypertension, \nhypercholesterolemia, chronic inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, allergic ec- \nzema, and other atopic disorders. \nIn part, these diseases arise from a chronic excess of Arachidonic Acid with a \nrelativedeficiency of y-linolenic and eicosapentaenoic acid in the membrane phospho- \nlipids of many cells (Booyens and van der Merwe, 1985). \nGeneral Immunologic and Pharmacologic Effects \nMale DBA/2 mice were used in a study to determine the potential role of \nArachidonic Acid and its metabolites in ultraviolet (UV) light-induced cutaneous \nimmune suppression (Rheins et al., 1987). Several groups of mice were fed a diet \ncontaining 0.15 mg/kg indomethacin on days l-5. Some of these and other groups of \nmice, which were fed normal diet, received dermal applications of 100 ~1 of \nArachidonic Acid (2.0 g!dl) in dimethyl sulfoxide:water (DMSO:H,O) or were exposed \nto UVB (FS 40 lamps, 11 mJ/cm2, 8.2 mJ UVB, 2.8 mJ UVA) on shaved backs on days \n2-5. On day 6, all rats were fed control feed and sensitized with applications of 25 ~1 of \n0.5% 2,4-dinitro-1-fluorobenzene (DNFB) on their backs. On day 13, baseline \nmeasurements of pinnal thickness were taken and the mice were then challenged with \n20 ~1 of 0.2% DNFB. Pinnal thickness was measured 24 h later to determine the \nreaction to DNFB. Negative controls were challenged with DNFB but were not \npreviously sensitized. A group of diluent controls was also used. \nMice treated with Arachidonic Acid or UVB only did differ significantly from \nnegative control animals in their response to DNFB. The mice treated with Arachidonic \nAcid and indomethacin had a significantly increased degree of pinnal swelling when \ncompared to mice given Arachidonic Acid only. The response to the DNFB challenge \nfor the mice treated with Arachidonic Acid or UVB and indomethacin was not \nsignificantly different from mice treated with diluent or indomethacin only. Arachi- \ndonic Acid caused an increase in the number of epidermal pigment cells, melanocyte \nhyperplasia, and induced melanogenesis; indomethacin, 0.15 mg/kg, abrogated \nArachidonic Acid’s immunosuppressiveeffects. Theauthorsproposed that Arachidonic \nAcid altered the cutaneous immune response, possibly by prostaglandin production. \nArachidonic Acid was applied to mouse skin to determine its effect on epidermal \nLangerhans cells and cutaneous immune reactivity (Rheins and Nordlund, 1986). A \ndose of 0.05 or 2% Arachidonic Acid was applied either to the back or the pinnae of the \nmice on days l-7; controls were treated with diluent, DMSO:water. \nUpon microscopic examination on day 8, it seemed that Arachidonic Acid had a \nbiphasic effect on Langerhans cells. A dose of 0.05% Arachidonic Acid increased \nidentifiable ATPase- and immune-associated (la)-positive Langerhans cells; 2% Arachi- \ndonic Acid decreased the identifiable cells. A distal effect on Langerhans cell popula- \ntions was not observed at either dose. SAFETY ASSESSMENT OF ARACHIDONIC ACID 487 \nMice dosed on the back, both dose groups, were sensitized with 0.5% DNFB on \ndays8 and 10; on day 15, the untreated pinna was challenged with 0.2% DNFB. A 62% \nincrease in pinnal edema was observed in the group dosed with 0.05% Arachidonic \nAcid; a 24% increase in edema was observed for DMSO-treated controls. Mice that had \na reduction in identifiable ATPase- and la-positive Langerhans cells after being dosed \nwith 2% Arachidonic Acid had only a 21% increase in pinnal edema; DMSO-treated \ncontrols had a 34% increase in edema. When the mice dosed on the pinna with 2% \nArachidonic Acid were sensitized and challenged as above, the Arachidonic Acid- \ntreated pinnae with fewer ATPase/la-positive cells had a 20% increase in edema after 24 \nh; the DMSO-treated controls had a 37% increase in edema. \nIn a study examining the effects of chronic intracutaneous administration of \nArachidonic Acid into the posterior aspect of both pinnae of female albino guinea pigs, \nonly minor dermal changes due to Arachidonic Acid administration were found \n(Ruzicka and Burg, 1987). Positive results were obtained by injection of some \nmetabolites of Arachidonic Acid. These results suggested that apart from hyperprolifer- \native and inflammatory dermatoses, lipoxygenase-derived Arachidonic Acid metabo- \nlites may be involved in the pathophysiologyof vasculitis and dermatoses characterized \nby tissue infiltrate of eosinophils. \nA study was conducted to examine whether sodium Arachidonate could trigger the \nreaction between normal human lymphocytes and rat isolated atria, therefore replacing \nthe initial triggering step provided by lectin stimulation of the lymphocyte’s membrane \n(Borda et al., 1984). Human lymphocytes incubated with sodium Arachidonate in vitro \nhad positive inotropic and chronotropic effects. Stimulation of lymphocytes with \nphytohemagglutinin resulted in a prompt release of Arachidonic Acid to the medium. \nExogenous Arachidonic Acid was added to phagocytic cells to determine the effects \nof Arachidonic Acid on various human polymorphonuclear and mononuclear leuko- \ncyte functions (Henricks et al., 1984). The effects of Arachidonic Acid on the \nphagocytic cell function were specific for neutrophils. Incubation with Arachidonic \nAcid resulted in large amounts of oxygen consumption, superoxide production, and \nchemiluminescence generation by neutrophils; these results were not observed for \nmonocytes. Neutrophils aggregated to a much greater degree than monocytes upon \nArachidonic Acid incubation. Neutrophil chemotaxis towards an attractant was lost \nand phagocytosis of bacteria decreased when incubated with Arachidonic Acid. At \nO”C, Arachidonic Acid incubation did not affect phagocytosis of staphylococci. \nMononuclear phagocytes were not affected at any temperature. \nThe oxidative degradation of unsaturated fatty acids was followed by the determi- \nnation of the amount of malonyldialdehyde, a metabolite formed during lipid peroxi- \ndation by oxygen metabolites. A dose-dependent response occurred when polymor- \nphonuclear leukocytes were incubated with Arachidonic Acid; a greater amount of \nmalonyldialdehyde was formed with a greater dose of Arachidonic Acid. \nIncubation of neutrophils with indomethacin prior to Arachidonic Acid incubation \nreduced the effects of Arachidonic Acid on the stimulation of neutrophil metabolism. \nlndomethacin partially abolished the decreasing effect of Arachidonic Acid on phago- \ncytosis and it inhibited the chemiluminescence response; indomethacin did not inhibit \noxygen consumption and glucose metabolism after Arachidonic Acid stimulation. An \noxygen species scavenger interfered with Arachidonic Acid’s effect on phagocytosis. \nArachidonic Acid metabolism in the skin of normal female Hartley guinea pigs, \nguinea pigs with contact dermatitis induced by 1 -chloro-2,+dinitrobenzene (DNCB) \nand guinea pigs with irritant dermatitis induced by a nicotinic acid derivative was 488 COSMETIC INGREDIENT REVIEW \ncompared (Ruzicka and Printz, 1982). The main metabolite of exogenous Arachidonic \nAcid in normal skin was HETE. In the presence of a cofactor, reduced glutathione, high \ncyclooxygenase activity was observed, with PGD, being the main product. There was \na marked inhibition of the !ipoxygenase pathway and the production of PGD, from \nArachidonic Acid with contact dermatitis. Dermal application of DNCB to unsensitized \nanimals resulted in increased PGE, production. With irritant dermatitis, there was an \ninhibition of the cyclooxygenase pathway in the epidermis; however, there was a \nstimulation of this pathway in the dermis, with PGE, being the main metabolite. PGH, \nmetabolism was unchanged; the Iipoxygenase pathway was slightly stimulated. \nANIMAL TOXICOLOGY \nAcute Toxicity \nAcute toxicity data are summarized in Table 3. Details of the studies are contained \nin the Appendix. \nDermal irritation \nArachidonic Acid in acetone solution, 25 t~l of a 4% w/v solution, was applied \ndaily, 5 days/wk for 3 wks, to the inner face of the right pinna of male OF1 mice \n(Bouclier et a!., 1989). The left pinna served as a control and was treated with vehicle \nonly. Animals were killed on days 1, 3,5, 12, and 19. The thickness of both pinnae was \nmeasured 4 h after Arachidonic Acid application. \nA marked increase in swelling of the treated pinnae was observed on day 1, \nswelling was reduced on day 2, and on days 3+, thickness of treated pinnae increased \nuntil reaching a plateau on day 10. A reduction of pinnal thickness associated with skin \natrophy was observed on the untreated pinna. \nAt microscopic examination, extracellular dermal edema was observed on day 1. \nDuring week 1, vascular congestion, erythrocyte extravasation, and polymorphonu- \nclear (PMN) infiltrates were observed in the dermis along with slight hyperplasia in the \nepidermis with necrosis and PMN infiltrates. Inflammation with PMN and mononuclear \ncell infiltrates was seen in the dermis, and some marked hyperkeratosis and a marked \nhyperplasia in the epidermis, during the second week. During the third week, \nregression of inflammation and marked epidermal hyperplasia were observed. \nApplication of Arachidonic Acid to mouse skin produced edema and inflammation \n(Fischer et al., 1989). High doses of Arachidonic Acid can cause ulceration of the skin. \nTeratogenic/Reproductive Effects \nArachidonic Acid was administered subcutaneously to pregnant female Sprague- \nDawley rats that were made diabetic by intravenous (i.v.) injections of 40 mg/kg \nstreptozotocin on day 6 of gestation (Goldman et al., 1985). One group of pregnant \ndiabetic rats was given 200 mg/kg/day Arachidonic Acid on days 9-12 of gestation; \nanother group of pregnant diabetic rats was given 200 mg/kg Arachidonic Acid twice \ndaily on days 5-l 0 of gestation. \nArachidonic Acid had no significant effect on maternal weight gain or blood \nglucose level. The weight gain per embryo in the diabetic rats was not significantly TABLE 3. ACUTE TOXKITY OF AKACHIDONIC Artn (I.V.

Some cultures had 1, 10, \n20, or 80 t.r&rnI sodium Arachidonate added to the male rat serum. \nAfter 48 h of incubation, no significant changes in the conceptuses due to 1 or 10 \nt.rg/mI Arachidonic Acid were observed. A significant increase in conceptus diameter \nand crown-rump length was observed due to the addition of 20 or 80 pg/ml \nArachidonic Acid. No embryonic malformations were observed at any concentration. \nArachidonic Acid was not teratogenic when added to control medium and, in fact, \nimprovement of conceptus development was observed. \nPrevention Teratogenic Effects \nArachidonic Acid had a significant protective effect against the teratogenic action of \nhyperglycemia (Goldman et al., 1985). The addition of Arachidonic Acid to hypergly- \ncemic serum medium reduced the number of hyperglycemic-induced conceptus \nmalformations such as an open neural tube, advanced neuropil formation in the \nneuroepithelium, significant reduction of the rough endoplasmic reticulum, decreased \nsize and number of lipid droplets, and increased number of lysosome-like structures in \nthe visceral endodermal yolk sac cells (Pinter et al., 1986). Addition of relatively high \nconcentrations of Arachidonic Acid to hyperglycemic medium prevented malforma- \ntions and many of the normally observed abnormalities in fatty acid composition in \nconceptuses cultured in hyperglycemic conditions (Pinter et al., 1988). \nSubcutaneous administration of Arachidonic Acid to pregnant diabetic rats signifi- \ncantly reduced neutral tube fusion defects, cleft palate, and micrognathia (Goldman \net al., 1985). \nPhenytoin disrupts normal embryonic development and produces teratogenic \neffects by interrupting the Arachidonic Acid cascade (Kay et al., 1988). Administration \nof exogenous Arachidonic Acid can reverse the effect of phenytoin. The occurrence of \nanomalies such as small, misshapen facial arches, small or misshapen head folds, and \nunfused neural tubes was significantly reduced by Arachidonic Acid administration. \nExogenous administration of Arachidonic Acid has, in vI’vo, significantly reduced \ncortisone-induced cleft palate in fetuses (Piddington et al., 1983). In vitro, a dose- \ndependent reversal by Arachidonic Acid of cortisol inhibition of epithelial breakdown \nin single palatal shelves has been demonstrated. \nAntimasculization of embryos was induced by a number of compounds (Gupta and \nGoldman, 1986). Arachidonic Acid dose-dependently reversed antimasculization \nproduced by estradiol-17p, cyproterone acetate, cortisone, and phenytoin. \nlndomethacin administration is able to stop the reversal of teratogenic effects by \nArachidonic Acid (Gupta and Goldman, 1986; Piddington et al., 1983). \nMUTAGENICITY \nArachidonic Acid mutagenicity studies are summarized in Table 4. \nChinese hamster embryonic lung fibroblasts, V79 cells, were used in assessing the \nmutagenic activity of Arachidonic Acid, based on the induction of 6-thioguanine \nresistance (TG’) (Sevanian and Peterson, 1989). incubation with 10 FM Arachidonic TABLE 4.

Eicosanoid concentration was significantly increased. \nDuring the first 3 h of incubation, a rapid initial \nuptake of Arachidonic Acid was independent of cell \ndivision; there was another distinct phase in which \nArachidonic Acid incorporation appeared to be a \nfunction of cell division. After 24 h, the proportion of \nArachidonic Acid in several lipid pools was \nincreased. After 24 h treatment with 220 PM \nArachidonic Acid, the frequency of TG’ colonies was \nsignificantly increased. Arachidonic Acid facilitated \nBPdiol mutagenic activity. Cell treatment with BPdiol \nfor 2 h produced a small, dose-dependent decrease \nin the surviving fraction of cells; no induction of TG’ \nmutants. BPdiol addition to cells pretreated with \nArachidonic Acid for 24 h resulted in a significant, \ndose-dependent increase in the frequency of TG’ \ncolonies; facilitation of BPdiol-induced TG’ colony \nformation had maximum effects after pretreatment \nwith 20-40 PM Arachidonic Acid. \nNordihydroguaiaretic acid inhibited Arachidonic \nAcid’s mutagenic activity.

PMA-stimulated \nphagocytes induced a significant increase in the \nnumber of SCEs. Phagocyte stimulation by \nArachidonic Acid and PMA resulted in the greatest \nnumber of SCEs. Indomethacin, nordihydroguaiaretic \nacid, and piroxicam significantly reduced the number \nof Arachidonic Acid-induced SCEs. Weitberg, 1988 TABLE 4.

Results and comments \nArachidonic Acid significantly increased the number of \nchromosomal aberrations; BP also increased the \nnumber of aberrations. Arachidonic Acid and BP \ncombined did not significantly increase the number \nof aberrations as compared to either compound \nalone.

Inhibitors of \nArachidonic Acid metabolism and steroidal and \nnonsteroidal inhibitors of the enzymatic oxidation of \nArachidonic Acid significantly decreased the number \nof oxygen radical-induced SCEs. Preincubation of \nCHO cells with low5 M vitamin E prior to the \naddition of Arachidonic Acid metabolism inhibitors \nproduced no oxygen radical-induced genetic toxicity. \nCells were also protected, but to a lesser extent, by \nvitamin E preincubation without the addition of \nArachidonic Acid metabolism inhibitors.

A significant increase in SCEs was \nseen after incubation with Arachidonic \nAcid-stimulated white blood cells. The greatest \nincrease in SCEs was observed when CHO cells were \nincubated with PMA-stimulated white blood cells in \nthe presence of Arachidonic Acid. \nRadioimmunoassayable PCE, was increased 1 T-fold in \nresponse to Arachidonic Acid. \n3-(glutathion-S-yl)-benzidine and 13H]benzidine \nbinding to DNA were observed. Arachidonic Acid \nincreased the thioether synthesis sixfold and DNA \nbinding fourfold; these increases were completely \ninhibited by indomethacin. \nA significant increase in MALs was observed in the \nArachidonic Acid-treated cultures. Cultures exposed \nto Arachidonic Acid and indomethacin had a \nsignificantly lower number of MALs than cultures \nexposed to only Arachidonic Acid. Weitberg and \nCalabresi, \n1986 \nZenser et al., \n1986 \nTelang et al., \n1984 \nArachidonic Acid produced approximately 1 .O-2.5.fold \ngreater incorporation of 3H-thymidine/mg cellular \nDNA than did the controls.

During \nthefirst hof incubation, a rapid initial UptakeofArachidonic Acid, independentofcell \ndivision, was observed. Another distinct phase followed in which Arachidonic Acid \nincorporation appeared to be a function of cell division. After 24 h, fatty acid \ncomposition analysis reported increased proportions of Arachidonic Acid in several \nlipid pools; V79 cell treatment with 10 PM Arachidonic Acid for 24 h approximately \ntripled the proportion of Arachidonic Acid in cell lipids and increased its proportions in \nphosphatidylcholine. The frequency of TG’ colonies was significantly increased after \n24 h treatment with 220 PM Arachidonic Acid. \nArachidonic Acid facilitated 7,8-dihydrobenzo[alpyrene (BPdiol) mutagenic activ- \nity. Treatment of V79 cells with BPdiol for 2 h produced a small, dose-dependent \ndecrease in the surviving fraction of cells; there was no induction of TG’ mutants. The \naddition of BPdiol to cells pretreated for 24 h with 10 FM Arachidonic Acid resulted in \na significant and dose-dependent increase in the frequency of TC’colonies. Facilitation \nof BPdiol-induced TG’ colony formation by Arachidonic Acid was concentration \ndependent, with maximum effects resulting after 24 h pretreatment with 20-40 PM \nArachidonic Acid. Nordihydroguaiaretic acid inhibited the mutagenic activity of \nArachidonic Acid. Negative and positive controls for the study were the vehicle \n(ethanol) and N-methyl-N-nitroso-N-nitroguanidine, respectively. \nThe mutagenic activity of Arachidonic Acid was examined by counting the number \nof sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) it induced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells \n(Weitberg, 1988). CHO cells were incubated with Arachidonic Acid 30 min prior to the \naddition of 10’ leukocytes. A concentration of 80 PM Arachidonic Acid significantly \nincreased the number of phagocyte-induced SCEs compared to the controls. \nThe effect of Arachidonic Acid and 12-0-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (PMA) \non the number of SCEs was also examined (Weitberg, 1988). PMA-stimulated phago- \ncytes induced a significant increase in the number of SCEs compared to the controls. \nPhagocyte stimulation with both Arachidonic Acid and PMA resulted in the production \nof the greatest number of SCEs. Indomethacin, nordihydroguaiaretic acid, and piroxi- \ncam, inhibitors of Arachidonic Acid metabolism, significantly reduced the number of \nSCEs induced by Arachidonic Acid. \nThe number of chromosomal aberrations was determined after human lymphocyte \ncultures were treated with 0.05 ml of 1 x 1 Om5 M Arachidonic Acid (Das et al., 1987). \nArachidonic Acid significantly increased the number of chromosomal aberrations as \ncompared to the controls. \nThe effect of the addition of 0.1 ml of 1 x lop6 M benzo[alpyrene (BP) was also \nexamined; BP increased the number of chromosomal aberrations. Addition of 0.05 ml \nof 1 x 1 Op5 M Arachidonic Acid and BP did not produce a significant increased in the \nnumber of abberations as compared to the addition of Arachidonic Acid or BP alone. \nArachidonic Acid, concentration not given, significantly increased the number of \nSCEs in CHO cells compared to controls, but produced less than the number observed \nwith an oxygen-radical generating system (Weitberg, 1987). The addition of Arachi- \ndonic Acid to hypoxanthine and xanthine oxidase, an oxygen-radical generator system, \nproduced a marked increase in the number of SCEs. Inhibitors of Arachidonic Acid \nmetabolism significantly decreased the number of oxygen radical-induced SCEs. \nSteroidal and nonsteroidal inhibitors of the enzymatic oxidation of Arachidonic Acid \nalso significantly reduced the number of oxygen-radical induced SCEs. Preincubation \nof CHO cells with 1 OK5 M vitamin E prior to the addition of inhibitors of Arachidonic \nAcid metabolism produced no oxygen radical-induced genetic toxicity. Cells were also SAFETY ASSESSMENT OF ARACHIDONIC ACID 499 \nprotected, but to a lesser extent, by pre-incubation with vitamin E without the addition \nof the inhibitors of Arachidonic Acid metabolism. \nThe effect on SCE induction by Arachidonic Acid alone and the effect of Arachi- \ndonic Acid’s presence on SCE induction due to BP or 7,12-dimethylbenzfalanthracene \n(DMBA) was investigated (Abe, 1986). Doses of 0.05 or 0.1 mM Arachidonic Acid did \nnot significantly change the baseline SCE frequency of the aryl hydrocarbon hydroxy- \nlase (AHH)-inducible human hematoma cell line C-HC-4, the AHH-noninducible rat \nascites hematoma cell line AH66-B, the rat esophageal neoplasm cell line Rl, or the \nChinese hamster cell line Don-6. \nSCE induction by BP or DMBA was significantly potentiated in the presence of \nArachidonic Acid in the C-HC-4 cells; induction enhancement was dependent \nupon the concentration of Arachidonic Acid. SCE enhancement due to the presence \nof Arachidonic Acid was also seen in the other three cell lines to a lesser, and some- \ntimes insignificant, extent. lndomethacin completely inhibited the potentiating ef- \nfect of Arachidonic Acid on SCE production by BP and DMBA in the C-HC-4 cell \nline. \nCultured CHO cells were incubated with 320 PM Arachidonic Acid and the \nnumber of SCEs was counted (Weitberg and Calabresi, 1986). A significant increase in \nSCEs was induced by Arachidonic Acid. Cultured CHO cells were also incubated with \nArachidonic Acid- and PMA-stimulated leukocytes. A significant increase in SCEs by \nArachidonic Acid-stimulated leukocytes was observed compared to the control. The \ngreatest increase in SCEs was observed when PMA-stimulated leukocytes were incu- \nbated with CHO cells in the presence of Arachidonic Acid. \nArachidonic Acid metabolism was studied in human urothelial cells to assess its \nrole in bladder cancer (Zenser et al., 1986). Urothelial cells increased radioimmunoas- \nsayable PGE, 1 l-fold in response to 100 PM Arachidonic Acid. The PGH synthase- \nmediated metabolism of the bladder carcinogen benzidine was assessed in intact tissue. \nIn intact tissue, 3-(glutathion-S-yl)-benzidine, a thioether product of peroxidatically- \nactivated benzidine, and 3H-benzidine binding to DNA were observed. Arachidonic \nAcid increased thioether synthesis sixfold and DNA binding fourfold; both of these were \ncompletely inhibited by 100 PM indomethacin. \nTelang et al. (1984) used an adult mouse mammary gland organ culture system \nassay to examine the effects- of Arachidonic Acid on the survival and growth of \nmammary alveolar lesions (MALs) from adult female Rlll mice. Mammary gland organ \ncultures were maintained for 8 days in medium supplemented with insulin, prolactin, \naldosterone, and hydrocortisone (IPAH medium) and then, on day 9, exposed to 10 \nL.r,g/rnl Arachidonic Acid in media containing insulin as the only hormone; control \ncultures were exposed to ethanol. The total duration in culture was 23 days. \nA significant increase in MAL number was observed in the cultures exposed to \nArachidonic Acid as compared to the controls. Cultures exposed to 10 pg/ml Arachi- \ndonic Acid plus 0.358 hg/rnl indomethacin had significantly less MALs compared to \ncultures exposed to Arachidonic Acid only. \nMammary gland organ cultures were continuously exposed to 10 pg/rnI Arachi- \ndonic Acid during an 8 day cultivation period in IPAH medium in a study to determine \nthe effect of Arachidonic Acid on incorporation of 3H-thymidine (Telang et al., 1984). \nControl cultures were exposed to ethanol. After treatment, both the test and control \ncultures were exposed to 5 T.Ki/ml of 3H-thymidine for 24 h. In three separate runs, \nArachidonic Acid produced -1 .O to 2.5fold greater incorporation of 3H-thymidine/mg \ncellular DNA than did the controls. 500 \nCARCINOGENICITY COSMETIC INGREDIENT REVIEW \nA brief summary of the metabolic biochemistry of Arachidonic Acid with emphasis \non the Arachidonic Acid cascade provides a basis for evaluating its role in tumor \npromotion. The essential fatty acids, linoleic and linolenic, must be supplied by the \ndiet; they serve as the metabolic precursors of Arachidonic Acid, an essential fatty acid. \nArachidonic Acid is the precursor of several hormones known as the eicosanoids, \nspecifically the prostaglandins (PG), thromboxanes (TX), and leukotrienes (LT). The \neicosanoids are highly effective cellular control elements. Phospholipids, particularly \nphosphatidyl choline, serve as the reservoir for Arachidonic Acid. Arachidonic Acid is \nliberated by the action of phospholipase, allowing for the synthesis of eicosanoids by \nthe cyclooxygenase and the Iipoxygenase pathways. The cyclooxygenase pathway is \nresponsible for the synthesis of several prostanoids, including PGE,. \nUsing the phorbol ester skin tumor production model system in mice, the following \nobservations were made that established an essential role for the Arachidonic Acid \ncascade in skin tumor promotion. Rohrschneider and Boutwell (1972) observed that the \nturnover rate of phosphatidyl choline in mouse skin was increased fourfold over the \nbasal level within 2 h after application of 18 nmol of the tumor-promoting phorbol ester \n12-0-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) to the skin, thereby liberating increased \namounts of Arachidonic Acid. Ashendel and Boutwell (1979) reported that, as a \nconsequence of the increased availability of Arachidonic Acid and the activation of \ncyclooxygenase caused by TPA, PGE, levels in mouse epidermis were elevated 1 O-fold \nwithin 6 h following application of 17 nmol of TPA to skin. Furstenberger and Marks \n(1980) confirmed and extended this observation, reporting that the PGE, level in the \nepidermis was elevated 6-fold within 90 min of treatment with 10 nmol of TPA. \nFurthermore, the application of cyclooxygenase inhibitors to mouse skin in conjunction \nwith TPA inhibited the formation ofskin tumors and the inhibition was reversed by PGE, \n(Verma et al., 1980). Nakadate et al. (1982) found that several inhibitors of phospholi- \npase A, the enzyme responsible for liberating Arachidonic Acid from phosphatidyl \ncholine, blocked a specific response to TPA in mouse that is dependent on the \nArachidonic Acid cascade. A study using SENCAR mice performed by Fischer et al. \n(1982) confirmed and extended the findings of Nakadate et al. (1982) to the promotion \nof neoplasms. They reported that the inhibition of the initial step of the Arachidonic \nAcid cascade (i.e., phospholipase A*) provided the most effective inhibition of \npromotion. This observation by Nakadate et al. and Fischer et al. (1982) may be \ninterpreted to mean that Iipoxygenase products as well as the cyclooxygenase product, \nPCE,, are critical components of the mechanisms of carcinogenesis. PGE, alone could \nnot promote skin tumors (Fischer, 1987; Furstenberger et al., 1987) nor could \nArachidonic Acid (Fischer et al., 1989). \nAgents other than TPA as well as complete carcinogens for various organs provide \nevidence that enhanced activity of the Arachidonic Acid cascade is a component of the \nmechanisms involved in tumor promotion. Thapsigargin, a non-TPA type tumor \npromoter, was found to stimulate Arachidonic Acid metabolism in rat peritoneal mast \ncells (Ohuchi et al., 1989). Brune et al. (1978) correlated initiating and promoting \nactivities of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and of diterpene (e.g., phorbol) esters in \nmouse skin with their prostaglandins releasing potency in vitro. Releasing activity \ncorrelated with promoting activity. \nAdditional evidence of a role for PG in carcinogenesis and therefore indirectly for \nthe Arachidonic Acid cascade is based on the inhibitory effect of cyclooxygenase SAFETY ASSESSMENT OF ARACHIDONIC ACID 501 \ninhibitors on carcinogenesis in various organs. Corwall et al. (1983) found that \nibuprofen given orally to hamsters inhibited hydrocarbon-induced cheek pouch \ncancer. lndomethacin inhibited-rat mammary gland tumorigenesis (Carter et al., 1983). \nMcCormicket al. (1985) confirmed that observation. A dose-related inhibition of colon \ncancer incidence induced by azoxymethane in rats attributable to piroxicam has been \nreported by Pollard and Locket? (1983) and by Reddy et al. (1987). Giving humans \nindomethacin resulted in a small but definite in vitro reduction of a biochemical marker \nof the tumor promoter TPA (Loprinzi et al., 1985). \nA study was conducted to determine the role of Arachidonic Acid in the stimulation \nof superoxide anion radical production by peritoneal macrophages stimulated with \nPMA (TPA); results of studies by Kensler and Trush (1984), Goldstein et al. (1981), and \nSlaga et al. (1981) suggested that free radicals and active species of oxygen may be \ninvolved in neoplasm promotion in mouse skin (Czerniecki and Witz, 1989). CD-l, \nC57BL/6, and SENCAR female mice were used. Inhibitors of Arachidonic Acid \nmetabolism inhibited O,- production. Arachidonic Acid metabolism stimulated by \nneoplasm promoters, such as TPA, could potentiate the production of superoxide anion \nradicals by murine peritoneal macrophages. \nExogenous Arachidonic Acid added to inflammatory mouse peritoneal macro- \nphages stimulated O,- production; however, Arachidonic Acid was much weaker in \nstimulating 02- production than TPA, which is a potent stimulator of the respiratory \nburst. Low concentrations of Arachidonic Acid potentiated by twofold the production \nof superoxide anion radicals by inflammatory macrophages treated with low concen- \ntrations of TPA. \nCLINICAL ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY \nIrritation \nThe irritation potential of a product containing 0.04% Arachidonic Acid was \nevaluated in a 24 h single insult patch test (CTFA, 1985a). The test article was applied, \nas received, under occlusive patch to 21 subjects; volume of test article applied, \nnumber of subjects per sex, and site of application were not given. Twenty-one subjects \nhad patches with control material; the control material was not identified. The primary \nirritation index (PII) of the test material was 0.03/4. No significant difference in irritancy \nwas observed between the test and control materials. \nA second 24 h single insult patch test was performed using the same procedure as \nabove with a product containing 0.04% Arachidonic Acid (CTFA, 1985b). There were \n17 subjects in both the test and control groups. The PII of the test material was O/4. No \nsignificant difference in irritancy was observed between the test and control materials. \nSUMMARY \nArachidonic Acid is an essential, polyunsaturated, fatty acid that is used as a \nsurfactant-cleansing agent and a surfactant-emulsifying agent in cosmetic formula- \ntions. Arachidonic Acid is a liquid at room temperature, is soluble in alcohol, ether, and \nwater, and absorbs in the ultraviolet B (UVB) range. In 1992, it was reported to the FDA \nthat Arachidonic Acid was used in 29 cosmetic formulations. 502 COSMETIC INGREDIENT REVIEW \nArachidonic Acid is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and the circulatory \nsystem, it distributes rapidly into the lipid compartment of the body, and is rapidly \nconverted to phospholipid by the liver. Arachidonic Acid can be metabolized by three \ndifferent pathways: the cyclooxygenase, Iipoxygenase, and cytochrome P4SO systems. \nArachidonic Acid metabolites are involved in the inflammatory process. A chronic \ncellular imbalance of Arachidonic, y-linolenic, and eicosapentaenoic acids, and of \ntheir respective eicosanoid derivatives, may have major health implications. Arachi- \ndonic Acid may alter the cutaneous immune response. \nIn a study in which Arachidonic Acid was applied to the pinnae of mice, an increase \nin pinnal thickness was observed. Microscopic effects were also observed throughout \nthe study. Application of Arachidonic Acid to mouse skin produced edema and \ninflammation, with high doses possibly causing ulceration of the skin. \nArachidonic Acid did not produce teratogenic effects. Exogenous Arachidonic Acid \nappeared to help prevent the teratogenic effects caused by hyperglycemia and \nphenytoin. Subcutaneous administration to pregnant diabetic rats significantly reduced \nneural tube fusion defects, cleft palate, and micrognathia. Arachidonic Acid has also \ndose-dependently reversed antimasculization caused by a number of compounds. \nHowever, indomethacin has been found to stop the reversal of teratogenic effects by \nArachidonic Acid. \nArachidonic Acid has mutagenic potential. Arachidonic Acid has increased the \nfrequency of TG’colonies, phagocyte-induced SCEs, chromosomal aberrations, thioether \nsynthesis, MAL number, and the incorporation of 13H]thymidine/mg cellular DNA. \nIn 24 h single insult patch tests, a formulation containing 0.04% Arachidonic Acid \nwas not an irritant. \nDISCUSSION \nThe CIR Expert Panel recognizes that dermal absorption data are lacking in this \nreport and believes that such data are necessary before a determination of safety can be \nmade. Based on the results of dermal absorption studies, there may be a need for \nadditional data. The studies by Rheins and Nordlund (1986) and Rheins et al. (1987) \nindicate that Arachidonic Acid may be involved in UV light-induced cutaneous \nimmune suppression. Therefore, immunomodulatory data may be requested (depen- \ndent on the results of the dermal absorption studies). In addition to immunomodulatory \ndata, carcinogenicity, photocarcinogenicity, and human irritation, sensitization, and \nphotosensitization data may also be requested. \nSection 1, paragraph (p) of the CIR Procedures states that “A lack of information \nabout an ingredient shall not be sufficient to justify a determination of safety.” In \naccordance with Section 30(j)(2)(A) of the Procedures, the Expert Panel informed the \npublic of its decision that the data on Arachidonic Acid are insufficient to determine \nwhether the ingredient, under each relevant condition of use, is either safe or unsafe. \nThe Panel released a “Notice of Insufficient Data Report” on February 12, 1992 \noutlining the data needed to assess the safety of Arachidonic Acid. The types of data \nrequired included: \n1. Dermal absorption data \nBased on the results of the absorption studies, the Panel indicated there may be \na need for the following data: SAFETY ASSESSMENT OF ARACHIDONIC ACID 503 \n2. lmmunomodulatory data \n3. Carcinogenicity and photocarcinogenicity data \n4. Human irritation, sensitization, and photosensitization data \nNo offer to supply the dermal absorption data was received. In accordance with \nSection 45 of the CIR Procedures, the Expert Panel will issue a Final Safety Evaluation \nReport-Insufficient Data. When the requested new data are available the Panel will \nreconsider the Final Report in accordance with Section 46 of the CIR Procedures, \nAmendment of a Final Report. \nCONCLUSION \nThe safety of this ingredient has not been documented and substantiated for \ncosmetic product use. The CIR Expert Panel cannot conclude whether Arachidonic \nAcid is safe for use in cosmetic products until the appropriate safety data have been \nobtained and evaluated. \nACKNOWLEDGMENT \nMonice M.

Hill3, Curtis D. Klaassen3, Daniel Liebler3,\nJames G. Marks, Jr.3, Ronald C. Shank3, Thomas J. Slaga3,\nPaul W. Snyder3, and F. Alan Andersen4\nAbstract\nThe Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel (Panel) asses sed the safety of 244 plant-derived fatty acid oils as used\nin cosmetics. Oils are used in a wide variety of cosmetic pro ducts for their skin condition ing, occlusive, emollient,\nand moisturizing properties. Since many of these oils are e dible, and their systemic to xicity potential is low, the\nreview focused on potential dermal effects. The Panel conc luded that the 244 plant-derived fatty acid oils are safe as\nused in cosmetics.\nKeywords\noils, safety, cosmetics\nIntroduction\nOils derived from edible vegetables, fruits, seeds, tree, and\nground nuts have been safely consumed by, and applied to\nthe skin of, humans for thousands of years. Although nuts,\nfruits, and vegetables themse lves may cause allergic reac-\ntions in certain individuals, the refined oils derived from\nthese plants generally pose no significant safety concern\nfollowing oral exposure, and their general biology is well\ncharacterized due to extensiv e use in food materials. Ini-\ntially used for anointing in re ligious ceremonies, oils and\ntheir components have also been used on the skin for their\nskin conditioning, occlusive, emollient, moisturizing, and\nother properties.\nThe full list of ingredients in this report, which includes\noils, hydrogenated oils, unsapon ifiables, oil fatty acids, and\nsalts of the fatty acids, is foun di nT a b l e1 .A l t h o u g hal a r g e\nnumber of oils derived from plants are included in this\nsafety assessment, there is a c ommonality in that they all\nare mixtures of triglycerides that contain fatty acids and\nfatty acid derivatives, the saf ety of which in cosmetics has\nbeen established. Thus, thi s safety assessment focused\nsolely on the basic chemistry, manufacturing and production\nmethods, uses, and irritation and sensitization potential of\nthese oils as used in cos metic ingredients.\nIn preparing this report, num erous inconsistencies were\nnoted with both taxonomic and In ternational Nomenclature\nCosmetic Ingredient (INCI) naming conventions. For exam-\nple, this report includes the macadamia nut ingredients,Macadamia integrifolia seed oil and Macadamia ternifolia\nseed oil, which are described in the International Cosmetic\nIngredient Dictionary and Handbook .1The species Mi n t e g -\nrifolia is currently the only species of macadamia nut which is\nused for oil production. The name M ternifolia is an old\nnaming convention for the edible nut that is currently used\nto describe a noncultivated, inedible species. Both Mi n t e g r i -\nfolia seed oil and Mt e r n i f o l i a seed oil are the same ingredient.\nSimilar naming conflicts have been discovered with Triticum\nvulgare (wheat) germ oil and Triticum aestivum (wheat) germ\noil,Orbignya oleifera seed oil and Orbignya speciosa kernel\noil, and Moringa pterygosperma seed oil and Moringa olei-\nferaseed oil, with these pairs being synonyms for each other.\nThe shea plant also has 2 species names, Butyrospermum\nparkii andVitellaria paradoxa .O n l y Bp a r k i i (asB parkii\n1Cosmetic Ingredient Review Scientific Analyst/Writer, Cosmetic Ingredient\nReview, Washington, DC, USA\n2Cosmetic Ingredient Review Senior Director, Cosmetic Ingredient Review,\nWashington, DC, USA\n3Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel Member, Cosmetic Ingredient\nReview, Washington, DC, USA\n4Cosmetic Ingredient Review Former Director, Cosmetic Ingredient Review,\nWashington, DC, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nBart Heldreth, Executive Director, Cosmetic Ingredient Review, 1620 L Street,\nNW, Suite 1200, Washington, DC 20036, USA.\nEmail: cirinfo@cir-safety.orgInternational Journal of Toxicology\n2017, Vol. 36(Supplement 3) 51S-129S\nªThe Author(s) 2017\nReprints and permission:\nsagepub.com/journalsPermissions.nav\nDOI: 10.1177/1091581817740569\njournals.sagepub.com/home/ijt\nTable 1.

The raw oil may include diglycerides, mono-\nglycerides, free fatty acids, plant sterols, pigments, glucosides,\nproteins, natural antioxidants, vitamins, and impurities.2,3The\nextent to which these components are removed during process-\ning varies. The available information on chemical properties of\noils in this report, including Food Chemicals Codex specifica-\ntions when provided, is found in Table 3.4The available fatty\nacid compositions for the oils in this report are found in Table 4.\nThe percentage of chemical constituents in individual oil\ntypes is dependent on the region where the oilseed plant is\ngrown, individual cultivars, and plant genetics.3This is espe-\ncially true with rapeseed, where the erucic acid content varies\nfrom 1%to 58.6%. Low erucic acid rapeseed oil is also known\nas canola oil.Table 2.

For\nexample, sunflower oil contains high levels of vitamins A, D,\nand K, whereas palm oil is a rich source of vitamins A and E.\nCrude sunflower oil also has the highest content of vitamin E in\nthe form of a-tocopherol among vegetable oils.3\nVegetable oil and hydrogenated vegetable oil are cosmetic\nlabeling names for blends of plant-derived oils.5The composi-\ntion of a blend is determined by the desired physical properties.\nVegetable oil and hydrogenated vegetable oil may include, but\nare not limited to, canola oil, Brassica campestris (rapeseed)\noil,Carthamus tinctorius (safflower) seed oil, Helianthus\nannuus (sunflower) seed oil, Sesamum indicum (sesame) seed\noil,Elaeis guineensis (palm) oil, E guineensis (palm kernel) oil,\nCocos nucifera (coconut) oil, Gossypium herbaceum (cotton-\nseed) oil, Glycine soja (soybean) oil, Zea mays (corn) oil, Olea\neuropaea (olive) oil, Prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond)\noil, and hydrogenated products of these oils.\nMethod of Manufacturing\nThe oil may be directly expressed from the source (seed or\npulp) followed by solvent extraction. Bailey Industrial Oil and\nFat Products states that the removal of pigments and polar\nmaterials is mandatory for most cosmetic applications.6The\nprocess used for oil refining for foods may be adequate for this\npurpose, or additional steps may be required. Special refining\nmethods to yield colorless and odorless oils are used by the\ncosmetic industry and include proprietary adsorption chroma-\ntography and supercritical fluid extractions.\nThe majority of the oils presented in this report are produced\neither from mechanical extraction or solvent extraction or a\nhybrid of both methods, known as prepress solvent extraction.3\nIn solvent extraction, hexane is the most commonly used sol-\nvent, as it is economical and easily removed from the extracted\noil. Seeds that are rich in oil can be cold pressed to extract oil\nwithout the use of solvents.7\nAfter the initial extraction by methods such as solvent\nextraction, the crude (degummed) oil is often refined.3The first\nstep is treating the oil with caustic soda to neutralize free fatty\nacids, hydrolyze phosphatides, and remove some colored pig-\nments and unsaponifiable materials. Soap stock is usually a by-\nproduct of this step. The next step involves treating the neu-\ntralized oil with activated earth to further adsorb pigments. The\nlast major step in refining oil is deodorizing, usually by a type\nof steam distillation, which is intended to remove all oxidative\ncleavage products that impart odor or flavor to the oil. Deodor-\nization also removes tocopherols, sterols, and other minor con-\nstituents of free fatty acids and undesirable foreign materials.\nFigure 2 is a flowchart of the basic refinement process.\nAfter deodorization, oils can be further processed by hydro-\ngenation, which makes oil more resistant to oxidative and ther-\nmal damage, and by winterization, where oil is slowly cooled to\npromote formation of crystals that cause cloudiness, and then\nfiltered to remove the crystals.\nCosmetic grade fatty acid plant oils may include a physical\nrefining step that involves heating crude oil under vacuum.7This step allows for the removal of volatile components such as\ncolor compounds, odor compounds, and free fatty acids, which\ngives the refined oil a lighter color, less odor, and lower acid\nvalues.\nAnalytical Methods\nNear-infrared spectroscopy and gas chromatography have been\nused, respectively, to phenotype and analyze fatty acid profiles\nin shea fat (described as V paradoxa , not B parkii ).8The fatty\nacid composition of hazel seed oil ( Corylus avellana , in crude\nform) has also been analyzed by gas chromatography.9The\ntriacylglycerol and diacylglycerol composition oils from hazel-\nnut, pistachio, almond, Brazil nut, and macadamia nuts have\nbeen characterized using high-performance liquid chromato-\ngraphy with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization and\nUV detection.10The triacylglycerol profile of Brazil nut oil\nhas also been quantified using dry matrix-assisted laser deso-\nrption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.11\nImpurities\nProteins. Many edible fatty acid oils are derived from foods that\nare recognized as potent food allergens. It has been shown that\nan individual who is allergic to a food will generally not react\nto the refined oil, especially if the oil has been “hot pressed” or\nhas undergone more processing.12,13A prime example is Ara-\nchis hypogaea (peanut) oil. Peanuts are extremely allergenic to\na large population, but reaction to the oil is rare. In its safety\nassessment on A hypogaea (peanut) oil, the Panel noted that the\nmajor concern associated with allergic reactions to peanuts is\nthe protein.14The protein does not partition into the refined oil,\nand therefore, the oil is safe for use in cosmetics. However,\nresearchers have reported protein levels in processed oils. Hal-\nsey et al reported that Lowry protein determinations of cold-\npressed and refined sunflower oil were found to be 2 to 8 mg/\nmL protein,15whereas Zitouni et al reported trace amounts of\nprotein in the refined oil.16Olszewski et al found 0.1 to 0.2 mg\nprotein per gram of peanut oil,17whereas Ramazzotti et al\nreported finding immunoglobulin E (IgE)-responsive residual\nproteins in peanut oil extracts.18Porras et al found soy protein\nin some samples of soy oil, but not others.19Awazuhara et al\nreported 1.4 to 4.0 mg protein per 100 g of soy oil.20Although\nPaschke et al found approximately 35 mg/L protein content in\nrefined soybean oil, no IgE-binding activity was detectable.21\nAlthough the Panel has found a general lack of clinical\neffects for fatty acid oils already reviewed,14,22–30other groups\nhave raised concerns. The Eu ropean Medicines Agency\n(EMEA) Working Party on Herbal Medicinal Products con-\ncluded that soy and peanut products “should be treated as aller-\ngenic unless they have an analytically monitored non-\nallergenic specification and a safe maximum daily dose.”31The\nEMEA found that threshold concentrations for induction of a\nprotein contact dermatitis were not available and recom-\nmended, “all medications for topical use containing soya or\npeanut products should be treated as allergenic.”74S International Journal of Toxicology 36(Supplement 3)Aflatoxin. Aflatoxins are metabolic products of the molds Asper-\ngillus flavus andAspergillus parasiticus . They are most often\nproduced in stored agricultural crops (such as peanuts and other\nnut crops) when growth conditions and genetic requirements\nare favorable.32–34The International Agency for Research on\nCancer (IARC) categorized aflatoxins as group 1 agents,\n“carcinogenic to humans.”35,36\nThe US government places the following limitations on pea-\nnuts to be considered “negative” for aflatoxin: /C2015 ppb for\n“peanuts which have been certified as meeting edible quality\ngrade requirements” and /C2025 ppb for “nonedible quality\ncategories” (7 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) sections\n997.30 and 998.200).37Aflatoxin contamination was not a con-\ncern in the previous CIR safety assessments of peanut oil,17\nhazelnut oil,41or coconut oil.29\nGlycidol. Glycidol and glycidol fatty acid esters have been\ndetected in refined fatty acid oils.38–41\nGossypol. Gossypol reportedly is present in refined cottonseed\noil at a concentration of /C200.01%.24The concentration ofgossypol in modified cottonseed products intended for human\nconsumption is limited by federal regulation (21CFR 112.894).\nUse\nCosmetic\nThe safety of the cosmetic ingredients addressed in this safety\nassessment is evaluated based on data received from the US\nFood and Drug Administration (FDA) and the cosmetics indus-\ntry on the expected use of these ingredients in cosmetics. Use\nfrequencies of individual ingredients in cosmetics are collected\nfrom manufacturers and reported by cosmetic product category\nin the FDA Voluntary Cosmetic Registration Program (VCRP)\ndatabase. Use concentration data are submitted by the cosmetic\nindustry in response to a survey, conducted by the Personal\nCare Products Council, of maximum reported use concentra-\ntions by product category.\nThere are 244 oil ingredients included in this safety assess-\nment, 146 of which are reported to be used; 118 of the in-use\ningredients have never been reviewed by CIR, while 28 haveCrude  Oil \nDegummed Oil Lecithin Sludge \nAlkali Refined Oil Soap Stock \nSalad Oil \nCooking Oil Salad and \nCooking Oil Partially \nHydrogenated Oil \nOther Fatty Oil \nShortening \nStockBlended Oils \nMargarine Stock Bleached Oil Salad Oil Water\nAlkali \nDeodorizationDeodorization Deodorization \nDeodorization \nDeodorization \nDeodorization Activated Earth \nH2, Catalyst \nWinterization & \nDeodorization \nFigure 2.

For the ingredients being reviewed\nfor the first time, the frequency of use42and/or concentration of\nuse43–45can be found in Table 5. (Also included in Table 5 are 3\ningredients, Citrullus vulgaris (watermelon) seed oil, macada-\nmia nut oil, and Vaccinium oxycoccos (cranberry) seed oil, that\ndo not have identifiable INCI names; these ingredients are not\npart of this assessment, but they are very similar to the oils that\nare part of this assessment, and in f o r m a t i o no nt h e mi si n c l u d e di n\nthis report for completeness.) For the ingredients that have been\nreviewed previously, the current and historical23–26,28,46–48fre-\nquency and concentration of use is given in Table 6. The 97 ingre-\ndients not currently reported t o be used are listed in Table 7.42–45,49,50\nOf the oils included in this report, Bp a r k i i (shea) butter has\nthe most reported uses in cosmetic and personal care products,\nwith a total of 1,950; 1,680 of those uses are in leave-on\nformulations. A recent survey of use concentrations for B\nparkii (shea) butter reports a max imum use concentration of\n60%in leave-on products as a cu ticle softener, a manicuring\napplication.51Helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil has the\nsecond greatest number of overall uses reported, with a total\nof 1,414; 1,054 of those uses are in leave-on formulations,\nhaving use concentrations up to 96 %. Many other ingredients\nare used in an extensive number of formulations. For exam-\nple, prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil, O europaea\n(olive) fruit oil, and Gs o j a (soybean) oil have 1,127, 915, and\n912 uses, respectively. Most o f the in-use ingredients have\nuses in both leave-on and rinse-off product types, many are\nused in products that are applied around the eye and some are\nused in a way they can possibly be ingested. Some are used in\nproducts that involve mucous membrane exposure, and a few\nare used in underarm deodorant formulations. Many of the\nproducts are used in formulati ons at relatively high concen-\ntrations. Olea europaea ( o l i v e )f r u i to i li su s e da tu pt o1 0 0 %,\nPersea gratissima (avocado) oil is used at up to 98 %,H\nannuus ( s u n f l o w e r )s e e do i la tu pt o9 6 %,a n d Gs o j a (soy-\nbean) oil at 95 %.\nOils are used in a wide variety of cosmetic products for their\nskin conditioning, occlusive, emollient, moisturizing, and other\nproperties. Some of the oils included in this report are used in\nproducts that can be inhaled, and effects on the lungs that may\nbe induced by aerosolized products containing these ingredi-\nents are of concern. The particle size of aerosol hair sprays and\nof pump hair sprays is 38 and >80 mm, respectively, and is\nrelatively large compared to respirable particle sizes ( /C2010\nmm). Therefore, because of their size, most aerosol particles\nare deposited in the nasopharyngeal region and are not\nrespirable.\nNone of the oils, hydrogenate d oils, unsaponifiables, oil\nfatty acids, and salts of the fatty acids described in this report\nwere restricted from use in any way under the rules governing\ncosmetic products in the European Union.52\nNoncosmetic\nThe primary use of plant-derived fatty acid oils is for cooking.\nPalm oil is the world’s most widely consumed edible oil (41.7million metric tons), followed by soybean oil, rapeseed oil,\nsunflower seed oil, cottonseed oil, peanut oil, palm kernel oil,\ncoconut oil, and olive oil.3,53Nonfood, noncosmetic uses for\nedible fatty acid oils are found in Table 8.\nToxicological Studies\nMany of the fatty acid oils in this assessment are edible, and\nexposure to the oils from food use would result in a much larger\nsystemic dose than that resulting from use in cosmetic prod-\nucts. Consequently, their systemic toxicity potential, except as\ndiscussed below relating to carcinogenicity, is not addressed in\nthis report. The safety focus of use of these oils as cosmetic\ningredients is the potential for irritation and sensitization.\nCarcinogenicity\nThe safety of glycidol fatty acid esters in refined vegetable oils\nwas assessed by IARC. Glycidol was determined to be a group\n2A (probably carcinogenic to humans) chemical, while glyci-\nd o lf a t t ya c i de s t e r sw e r ed e t e r m i n e dt ob eag r o u p3( n o t\nclassifiable as to carcinogenicity to humans) chemical.40,41\nThe Federal Institute for Risk Assessment in Germany\nreleased a summary of their initial evaluation of the assessment\nof levels of glycidol fatty acid esters detected in refined vege-\ntable fats.39Although acknowledging that the levels of glycidol\nthat may be released from glycidol fatty acid esters are not\nknown, the evaluation noted that glycidol is classified as prob-\nably carcinogenic to humans. The evaluation was based on\nfindings of the German Chemical and Veterinary Test Agency\nthat noted that glycidol is converted to 3-chloropropanediol and\nit appeared to be the 3-chloropropanediol that was detected in\nthe vegetable fat.38The levels of 3-chloropropanediol were\nnegligible at the crude oil, degummed, neutralized, and\nbleached stages, but levels were significant at the deodorized\nstage.\nAnacardium occidentale (Cashew) Seed Oil\nThe modulatory effect of A occidentale (cashew) seed oil on\nantioxidant potential was investigated in female Swiss albino\nmice in a 120-day skin papillomagenesis study.54The mice\nwere divided into 4 groups of 15 and 1 group of 10 (vehicle\ncontrol). Test groups were as follows: group I was the vehicle\ncontrol, receiving 0.1 mL acetone; group II was the positive\ncontrol, receiving a single dose of 7,12-dimethylbenz( a)anthra-\ncene (DMBA; 0.005 mg/0.05 mL acetone) followed by appli-\ncations of 2 %croton oil 3 times a week until study termination;\ngroup III received a single dose of DMBA followed by appli-\ncations of 2.5 %cashew nut kernel oil 3 times a week until\nstudy termination; group IV received a single dose of DMBA\nfollowed by applications of 5 %cashew nut kernel oil 3 times a\nweek until study termination; and group V received 5 %cashew\nnut kernel oil applied until study termination. The oil was\napplied to the clipped dorsal scapular region that was 2 cm in\ndiameter. Body weights were recorded at regular intervals.76S International Journal of Toxicology 36(Supplement 3)Table 5.

Elaeis guineensis (palm) oil, 5%,\nwas nonallergenic in a maximization study23\nGossypium herbaceum (cotton) seed oil\nCosmetic formulations containing 3.4% to 8.97% hydrogenated cottonseed oil were not irritating to rabbit skin24\nOryza sativa (rice) bran oil\nUndiluted Oryza sativa (rice) bran oil was not irritating to rabbits, and in a guinea pig maximization study, no reactions were observed\nwhen 5% was used at induction and 25% and 50% Oryza sativa (rice) bran oil were used at challenge. An Oryza sativa (rice) bran oil/\nOryza sativa (rice) germ oil mixture, concentrations not stated, did not cause a contact allergy response. Undiluted hydrolyzed rice\nprotein was also not irritating or sensitizing25\nOryza sativa (rice) germ oil\nOryza sativa (rice) germ oil was not a primary dermal irritant25\nPrunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil\nUndiluted prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil and 2 moisturizer formulations, each containing 25% prunus amygdalus dulcis\n(sweet almond) oil, were tested for skin irritancy in rabbits using occlusive patches. Undiluted prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet\nalmond) oil was nonirritating (primary irritation index, PII ¼0/4). The formulations containing 25% prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet\nalmond) oil were minimally irritating (PIIs ¼0.28 and 0.72, respectively).\nIn a 60-day cumulative irritation test, 10% and 100% prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil was applied to rabbits. When tested\nin 7 separate trials, 100% prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil produced mean maximum irritation indices (MMIIs) ranging\nfrom 0.34 to 1.34 (maximum score ¼8). At a concentration of 10%, MMIIs for this ingredient ranged from 0 to 0.66. Results\nindicated that, when applied to the skin over a long period of time, prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil is slightly irritating;\nwhereas at 10%, it is practically nonirritating\nA maximization assay was used to determine the sensitizing potential of prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil using guinea\npigs. Intradermal induction used concentrations of 5% amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil, the dose-range phase of the\nexperiment used a single dermal application of 5%, 10%, or 100% Prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil, a booster induction\ninjection of 100% Prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil was applied occlusively for 48 hours 1 week later, challenge was\nwith 5% prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil in petrolatum applied topically under occlusion for 24 hours. Prunus amygdalus\ndulcis (sweet almond) oil was nonsensitizing\nUndiluted prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil was tested for irritancy in groups of 6 male albino rabbits. The test material\nwas applied under occlusion to the clipped intact and abraded dorsal skin of each animal. Twenty-three hours later, patches were\nremoved; sites were scored at 24 and 48 hours. The primary irritation indices (PIIs) for 7 test samples of prunus amygdalus dulcis\n(sweet almond) oil ranged from 0 to 0.18 (maximum score ¼8), indicating that this ingredient is practically nonirritating to skin208\n(continued)Burnett et al 95Sguinea pig skin, and 5 %aqueous solutions of a bar soap con-\ntaining 13 %sodium cocoate had irritation scores of 1.6 to 4.0\nof 8 in animal studies. However, the majority of the remaining\nanimal irritation and/or sensitization studies conducted on a\nlarge number of the oils included in this report, primarily in\nformulation, did not report any significant irritation or sensiti-\nzation reactions, indicating that refined oils derived from plants\nare not dermal irritants or sensitizers. None of the tested oils,\nincluding B parkii (shea) butter (up to 20 %) and Oryza sativa\n(rice) germ oil ( /C2075%), were phototoxic in animal studies. The\ncomedogenicity of C avellana (hazel) seed oil was evaluated\nusing rabbits, and a slight difference in the number and size of\nthe pilosebaceous follicles and a slight excess of sebum and a\ndilation of the follicles were observed.\nHuman\nPlant-derived fatty acid oils are commonly believed to be safe\nfor use on the skin.6de Groot notes that no documentation\nexists to show that high-quality edible lipids cause adverse\nreactions in normal individuals (except for potential comedo-\ngenicity).55Very few reports of adverse reactions to cosmetic\nuse of edible fatty acid oils have been reported.\nMany plant-derived fatty acid oils are derived from foods\nthat are recognized as potent food allergens. The allergic reac-\ntions are thought to be caused by the proteins present in the\nfood. It has been shown that an individual who is allergic to a\nfood will generally not react to the refined oil, especially if theoil has been “hot pressed” or has undergone more process-\ning.12,13In its safety assessment on A hypogaea (peanut) oil,\nthe Panel noted that while peanuts are extremely allergenic to a\nlarge population, reaction to the oil is rare. The major concern\nassociated with allergic reactions to peanuts is the protein,14\nwhich does not partition into the refined oil; therefore, the oil is\nsafe for use in cosmetics. Crevel et al also concluded that\nchemically refined peanut oil is safe for the majority of peanut\nallergic individuals.13They stated that “as peanut is acknowl-\nedged to be one of the most potent food allergens, it is reason-\nable to extrapolate the conclusions drawn up for peanut oil to\nother edible oils.” However, they concede that validated ana-\nlytical methodology for establishing the protein content of oil is\nneeded.\nIn support of the conclusions stated earlier, Crevel et al also\nexamined the allergenicity of some other oils. Very few\ninstances of allergic reactions to other major edible fatty acid\noils have been reported. Even sesame oil, which differs from\nthe other oils, is used as a flavorant and, therefore, is not\nrefined, is expected to contain significantly more protein than\nthe other edible fatty acid oils, and has had very few reports of\nallergic reaction. Additional studies demonstrating safety are\nsummarized later in this section.15,56\nA large number of clinical irritation and sensitization studies\nwere made available on many of the oils, primarily in formula-\ntion, and these studies are summarized in Table 11. All of the\ndata indicated that the oils were not irritants or sensitizers.\nSummary statements of human dermal studies, includingTable 10.

Although\nthe majority of the oils were nonirritating to mildly irritating, a few\nstudies indicated some significant irritation. For example, a lotion\ncontaining 1.5 %E guineensis (palm) oil was moderately irritating\nto rabbit eyes, and a mascara containing 9.4 %Linum usitatissimum\n(linseed) seed oil was predicted to be moderately irritating in an\nalternative assay. Available ocu lar irritation studies are summar-\nized in Table 13. Summary statements of ocular irritation studies\nfrom previous CIR reports on oils are provided in Table 14.\nHuman\nIn clinical ocular irritation studies, formulations containing\n9.4%L usitatissimum (linseed) oil and 0.2 %Ribes nigrum\n(blackcurrant) seed oil did not produce adverse reactions and\nwere considered safe for contact lens wearers. These studies are\nalso summarized in Table 13.\nClinical Studies\nClinical Trials/Case Studies\nPlant-derived fatty acid oils have been used as vehicles for\ndelivery of therapeutic agents or used alone in treating skin\ndisorders. Adverse reactions to the oils were notably absentin such clinical tests. Case studies have reported isolated aller-\ngic reactions. The available data are summarized in Table 15.\nSummary\nThe report addresses the safety of plant-derived fatty acid oils.\nThese oils, which are derived from vegetable and fruit plants,\nare composed of monoglycerides, diglycerides, and primarily\ntriglycerides, free fatty acids, and other minor components,\nincluding natural antioxidants and fat-soluble vitamins. The\npercentage of chemical constituents and nutritional content of\nindividual oil types is dependent on region where the oil plant\nis grown, individual cultivars, and plant genetics. Oils used in\ncosmetics are likely produced in the same manner as those used\nin the food industry. Oils may be expressed through mechanical\nor solvent extraction. The oils may undergo further refining,\nsuch as neutralizing, bleaching, and deodorizing, to remove pig-\nments, odors, unsaponifiable materials, and other undesirables.\nSo that all plant-derived fatty acid oils that are cosmetic\ningredients are included in 1 report, several ingredients that\nhave been reviewed previously by the Panel are included in\nthis report. The ingredients, their conclusions, and citations are\nfound in Table 2. Some study results utilized in those previous\nsafety assessments were also utilized in this safety assessment\nand cited below where appropriate.\nIndividuals who have food allergies to a plant protein rarely\nexhibit allergic reactions when exposed to refined oils of the\nsame plant. Data evaluation by the Panel regarding the method\nof manufacture indicates that protein constituents do not parti-\ntion into the refined oils. The Panel has also found a general lack\nof clinical effects for fatty acid oils that they have already\nreviewed; however, other researchers have raised concerns about\nthe presence of residual proteins in oils, such as peanut and soy.Table 11.

Cosmetic formulations\ncontaining 10.6% to 20.86% hydrogenated cottonseed oil were not irritating or sensitizing.24\nOryza sativa (rice) bran oil\nRice is generally regarded as hypoallergenic, although some case studies of allergic reactions to raw rice have been reported. In\nclinical testing, formulations containing 1.04% to 8.0% Oryza sativa (rice) bran oil were not irritating or sensitizing. Hydrolyzed rice\nprotein was not irritating to human participants.25\nPersea gratissima (avocado) oil\nPersea gratissima (avocado) oil was not an irritant or sensitizer when human participants were patch tested with cosmetic\nformulations containing up to 10.7% Persea gratissima (avocado) oil or in patch tests using 100% Persea gratissima (avocado) oil.27\nPrunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil\nUndiluted Prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil was nonirritating in a single insult patch test with 101 participants, and it was\nnonirritating and nonsensitizing in an HRIPT using 52 participants. Cosmetic formulations containing 0.1% to -5% were practically\nnonirritating and nonsensitizing in HRIPTs performed with 6,906 participants.

The safety focus of use\nof these oils as cosmetic ingredients is on the potential for\nirritation and sensitization. Undiluted, technical grade, A hypo-\ngaea (peanut) oil was moderately irritating to rabbits and gui-\nnea pig skin, and 5 %aqueous solutions of a bar soap containing\n13%sodium cocoate had irritation scores of 1.6 to 4.0 of 8 in\nanimal studies. However, the majority of the remaining animal\nirritation and/or sensitization studies conducted on a large num-\nber of the oils included in this report, primarily in formulation,\ndid not report any significant irritation or sensitizationreactions, indicating that refined oils derived from plants are\nnot dermal irritants or sensiti zers. None of the tested oils,\nincluding B parkii (shea) butter (up to 20 %) and O sativa (rice)\ngerm oil ( /C2075%), were phototoxic in animal studies. The\ncomedogenicity of C avellana (hazel) seed oil was evaluated\nusing rabbits, and a slight difference in the number and size of\nthe pilosebaceous follicles and a slight excess of sebum and a\ndilation of the follicles were observed.\nThe results of a large number of clinical irritation, sensitiza-\ntion, and photoxicity/photosensitziation studies indicated that\nplant-derived fatt acid oils were not irritants or sensitizers in\nhumans. In clinical testing with an eye mask containing 0.2 %\nRibes nigrum (blackcurrant) seed oil (undiluted), the formula-\ntion was noncomedogenic.Table 14.

An eye mask containing 0.2 %R nigrum (black-\ncurrant) seed oil (undiluted) was tested and considered safe for\ncontact lens wearers.\nPlant-derived fatty acid oils have been used as vehicles for\ndelivery of therapeutic agents or used alone in treating skin\ndisorders. Adverse reactions to the oils were notably absentin such clinical tests. Case studies have reported isolated aller-\ngic reactions.\nDiscussion\nPlant-derived fatty acid oils, oils which have been hydroge-\nnated to reduce or eliminate unsaturation, fatty acid salts, and\noil unsaponifiables were reviewed by the Panel. Most of these\ningredients in this report are mixtures of triglycerides contain-\ning fatty acids and fatty acid derivatives, the safety of which in\ncosmetics has been established. Upon review of these ingredi-\nents, the Panel expressed concern regarding gossypol (for\ncotton-derived ingredients), pesticide residues, and heavy\nmetals that may be present in botanical ingredients. The Panel\nstressed that the cosmetics industry should continue to use theTable 15. (continued)\nIngredient Patients/condition Effect/observation Reference\nOlea europaea (olive) fruit oil\nOlea europaea (olive) fruit oil Throughout the literature, it is stated that sensitization to\nOlea europaea (olive) fruit oil is considered rare. Case\nreports have been described, however, and generally\ninvolved patients with venous eczema, some type of\ndermatitis or lesion, or an occupational exposure. Patch\ntesting with Olea europaea (olive) fruit oil produced positive\nreactions in most of these cases, and these results were\nusually regarded as allergenic. The concentrations of Olea\neuropaea (olive) fruit oil tested were not always given, but,\nwhen stated, test concentrations giving positive results,\nranged from 30% to100%. When the constituents of olive oil\nwere tested as well, the results of that testing were negative.318–325\nOlea europaea (olive) fruit oil Whether the reactions to olive oil were contact\nsensitization or irritation were investigated using open and\nocclusive testing. It was concluded that olive oil presented as\na weak irritant rather than a contact sensitizer in the few\ncase studies was observed.326\nPersea gratissima (avocado) oil\nPersea gratissima (avocado)\noil1 female; dermatitis around the\neyes and earlobesPatch testing with her sunscreen resulted in positive results. In\nsubsequent patch testing of the ind ividual ingredients, a positive\nreaction to undiluted oil, but not to the active ingredient, was\nobserved; 20 control participants were involved, and reactions\ntoPersea gratissima (avocado) oil were not seen.327\nSesamum indicum (sesame) seed oil\nSesamum indicum (sesame)\nseed oil in an ointmentFemale Pruritic erythema, papules, and vesicles appeared after\napplication of the ointment; patch testing was performed\nwith the ointment and with the individual ingredients,\nincluding undiluted Sesamum indicum (sesame) seed oil.\nBoth the ointment and Sesamum indicum (sesame) seed oil\nproduced positive reactions on days 2, 3, 4, and 1; the other\ncomponents did not cause a reaction.\nResults were negative in patch testing of Sesamum indicum\n(sesame) seed oil using 20 healthy participants.328\nAbbreviations: IgE, immunoglubulin E; IgG4, immunoglobulin G4.114S International Journal of Toxicology 36(Supplement 3)necessary procedures to limit these impurities in the ingredient\nbefore blending into cosmetic formulations.\nAdditionally, the Panel considered the safety of glycidol\nand glycidol fatty acid esters in refined vegetable oils.\nAlthough the Panel recognizes that these impurities may be\ncarcinogenic, absorption through the skin would be very low\nand likely does not pose a significant hazard. Nonetheless,\nsuppliers should take steps to eliminate or reduce the presence\nof glycidol and glycidol fatty acid esters in plant-based fatty\nacid oils that are used in cosmeti c products. Aflatoxins, which\nare potent carcinogens, may be present in moldy nuts and\ncoconut copra but are not found i no i l se x p r e s s e df r o mt h e s e\nnuts and copra. The Panel adopted the US Department of\nAgriculture designation of /C2015 ppb as corresponding to\n“negative” aflatoxin content.\nCertain plant-derived oils are used in cosmetic products that\nmay be inhaled during their use. In practice, however, the par-\nticle sizes produced by the cosmetic aerosols are not respirable.\nThe Panel discussed the relationship between food allergies\nand exposure to refined oils. Individuals who have food aller-\ngies to a plant protein rarely exhibit allergic reactions when\nexposed to refined oils of the same plant. The Panel has found a\ngeneral lack of clinical effects for plant-derived fatty acid oils\nalready reviewed.\nFatty acid composition data were available for the majority\nof the oils included in this review and the Panel agreed that the\ncomposition data, in combination with the available data on\nmethod of manufacture, impur ities, safety test data, a long\nhistory of safe use in foods, and an absence of adverse reactions\nin clinical experience, were a sufficient basis for determining\nsafety. The Panel did note that vegetable oil is a blend of a\nnumber of different oils and that a specific composition of\nvegetable oil was not available. The Panel determined that the\nsafety of vegetable oil as used in cosmetic formulations has\nbeen established, providing t hat the blend contains oils for\nwhich the fatty acid composition is known.\nAdditionally, although data on th e fatty acid composition of\nFragaria vesca (strawberry) seed oil and Fragaria virginiana\n(strawberry) seed oil were not available, data were available for\nFragaria ananassa (strawberry) seed oil and Fragaria chiloensis\n(strawberry) seed oil. In that the fatty acid compositions of F ana-\nnassa andF chiloensis (strawberry) seed oil were similar to each\nother and it was assumed that Fv e s c a andF virginiana (strawberry)\nseed oils would also have similar fatty acid compositions.\nThe Panel also noted that arachidonic acid is a fatty acid\nconstituent of Lycium barbarum seed oil, O sativa (rice) germ\noil, and Sclerocarya birrea seed oil. Although a previously\npublished CIR evaluation concluded that insufficient data exist\nto support the safety of arachidonic acid in cosmetic products,\nthe Panel was of the opinion that the concentration of use of\nthese ingredients was sufficiently low that the amount of free\narachidonic acid from these oils would not warrant concern.\nFinally, the conclusion reached by the Panel on the safety of\nthe plant-derived fatty acid oils supersedes the 2001 conclusion\nof insufficient data for Corylus americana and C avellana\n(hazel) seed oil.Conclusion\nThe Panel concluded that the 244 plant-derived fatty acid oils\nincluded in this review are safe in the present practices of use\nand concentration described in this safety assessment. Were\ningredients not in current use (as indicated by *) to be used\nin the future, the expectation is that they would be used in\nproduct categories and concentrations comparable to others\nin this group.
