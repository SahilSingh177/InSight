Alan Andersen4\nAbstract\nThe Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel (Panel) asses sed the safety of 244 plant-derived fatty acid oils as used\nin cosmetics. Oils are used in a wide variety of cosmetic pro ducts for their skin condition ing, occlusive, emollient,\nand moisturizing properties. Since many of these oils are e dible, and their systemic to xicity potential is low, the\nreview focused on potential dermal effects. The Panel conc luded that the 244 plant-derived fatty acid oils are safe as\nused in cosmetics.\nKeywords\noils, safety, cosmetics\nIntroduction\nOils derived from edible vegetables, fruits, seeds, tree, and\nground nuts have been safely consumed by, and applied to\nthe skin of, humans for thousands of years. Although nuts,\nfruits, and vegetables themse lves may cause allergic reac-\ntions in certain individuals, the refined oils derived from\nthese plants generally pose no significant safety concern\nfollowing oral exposure, and their general biology is well\ncharacterized due to extensiv e use in food materials. Ini-\ntially used for anointing in re ligious ceremonies, oils and\ntheir components have also been used on the skin for their\nskin conditioning, occlusive, emollient, moisturizing, and\nother properties.\nThe full list of ingredients in this report, which includes\noils, hydrogenated oils, unsapon ifiables, oil fatty acids, and\nsalts of the fatty acids, is foun di nT a b l e1 .A l t h o u g hal a r g e\nnumber of oils derived from plants are included in this\nsafety assessment, there is a c ommonality in that they all\nare mixtures of triglycerides that contain fatty acids and\nfatty acid derivatives, the saf ety of which in cosmetics has\nbeen established. Thus, thi s safety assessment focused\nsolely on the basic chemistry, manufacturing and production\nmethods, uses, and irritation and sensitization potential of\nthese oils as used in cos metic ingredients.\nIn preparing this report, num erous inconsistencies were\nnoted with both taxonomic and In ternational Nomenclature\nCosmetic Ingredient (INCI) naming conventions. For exam-\nple, this report includes the macadamia nut ingredients,Macadamia integrifolia seed oil and Macadamia ternifolia\nseed oil, which are described in the International Cosmetic\nIngredient Dictionary and Handbook .1The species Mi n t e g -\nrifolia is currently the only species of macadamia nut which is\nused for oil production. The name M ternifolia is an old\nnaming convention for the edible nut that is currently used\nto describe a noncultivated, inedible species. Both Mi n t e g r i -\nfolia seed oil and Mt e r n i f o l i a seed oil are the same ingredient.\nSimilar naming conflicts have been discovered with Triticum\nvulgare (wheat) germ oil and Triticum aestivum (wheat) germ\noil,Orbignya oleifera seed oil and Orbignya speciosa kernel\noil, and Moringa pterygosperma seed oil and Moringa olei-\nferaseed oil, with these pairs being synonyms for each other.\nThe shea plant also has 2 species names, Butyrospermum\nparkii andVitellaria paradoxa .O n l y Bp a r k i i (asB parkii\n1Cosmetic Ingredient Review Scientific Analyst/Writer, Cosmetic Ingredient\nReview, Washington, DC, USA\n2Cosmetic Ingredient Review Senior Director, Cosmetic Ingredient Review,\nWashington, DC, USA\n3Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel Member, Cosmetic Ingredient\nReview, Washington, DC, USA\n4Cosmetic Ingredient Review Former Director, Cosmetic Ingredient Review,\nWashington, DC, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nBart Heldreth, Executive Director, Cosmetic Ingredient Review, 1620 L Street,\nNW, Suite 1200, Washington, DC 20036, USA.\nEmail: cirinfo@cir-safety.orgInternational Journal of Toxicology\n2017, Vol. 36(Supplement 3) 51S-129S\nªThe Author(s) 2017\nReprints and permission:\nsagepub.com/journalsPermissions.nav\nDOI: 10.1177/1091581817740569\njournals.sagepub.com/home/ijt\nTable 1.

For\nexample, sunflower oil contains high levels of vitamins A, D,\nand K, whereas palm oil is a rich source of vitamins A and E.\nCrude sunflower oil also has the highest content of vitamin E in\nthe form of a-tocopherol among vegetable oils.3\nVegetable oil and hydrogenated vegetable oil are cosmetic\nlabeling names for blends of plant-derived oils.5The composi-\ntion of a blend is determined by the desired physical properties.\nVegetable oil and hydrogenated vegetable oil may include, but\nare not limited to, canola oil, Brassica campestris (rapeseed)\noil,Carthamus tinctorius (safflower) seed oil, Helianthus\nannuus (sunflower) seed oil, Sesamum indicum (sesame) seed\noil,Elaeis guineensis (palm) oil, E guineensis (palm kernel) oil,\nCocos nucifera (coconut) oil, Gossypium herbaceum (cotton-\nseed) oil, Glycine soja (soybean) oil, Zea mays (corn) oil, Olea\neuropaea (olive) oil, Prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond)\noil, and hydrogenated products of these oils.\nMethod of Manufacturing\nThe oil may be directly expressed from the source (seed or\npulp) followed by solvent extraction. Bailey Industrial Oil and\nFat Products states that the removal of pigments and polar\nmaterials is mandatory for most cosmetic applications.6The\nprocess used for oil refining for foods may be adequate for this\npurpose, or additional steps may be required. Special refining\nmethods to yield colorless and odorless oils are used by the\ncosmetic industry and include proprietary adsorption chroma-\ntography and supercritical fluid extractions.\nThe majority of the oils presented in this report are produced\neither from mechanical extraction or solvent extraction or a\nhybrid of both methods, known as prepress solvent extraction.3\nIn solvent extraction, hexane is the most commonly used sol-\nvent, as it is economical and easily removed from the extracted\noil. Seeds that are rich in oil can be cold pressed to extract oil\nwithout the use of solvents.7\nAfter the initial extraction by methods such as solvent\nextraction, the crude (degummed) oil is often refined.3The first\nstep is treating the oil with caustic soda to neutralize free fatty\nacids, hydrolyze phosphatides, and remove some colored pig-\nments and unsaponifiable materials. Soap stock is usually a by-\nproduct of this step. The next step involves treating the neu-\ntralized oil with activated earth to further adsorb pigments. The\nlast major step in refining oil is deodorizing, usually by a type\nof steam distillation, which is intended to remove all oxidative\ncleavage products that impart odor or flavor to the oil. Deodor-\nization also removes tocopherols, sterols, and other minor con-\nstituents of free fatty acids and undesirable foreign materials.\nFigure 2 is a flowchart of the basic refinement process.\nAfter deodorization, oils can be further processed by hydro-\ngenation, which makes oil more resistant to oxidative and ther-\nmal damage, and by winterization, where oil is slowly cooled to\npromote formation of crystals that cause cloudiness, and then\nfiltered to remove the crystals.\nCosmetic grade fatty acid plant oils may include a physical\nrefining step that involves heating crude oil under vacuum.7This step allows for the removal of volatile components such as\ncolor compounds, odor compounds, and free fatty acids, which\ngives the refined oil a lighter color, less odor, and lower acid\nvalues.\nAnalytical Methods\nNear-infrared spectroscopy and gas chromatography have been\nused, respectively, to phenotype and analyze fatty acid profiles\nin shea fat (described as V paradoxa , not B parkii ).8The fatty\nacid composition of hazel seed oil ( Corylus avellana , in crude\nform) has also been analyzed by gas chromatography.9The\ntriacylglycerol and diacylglycerol composition oils from hazel-\nnut, pistachio, almond, Brazil nut, and macadamia nuts have\nbeen characterized using high-performance liquid chromato-\ngraphy with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization and\nUV detection.10The triacylglycerol profile of Brazil nut oil\nhas also been quantified using dry matrix-assisted laser deso-\nrption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.11\nImpurities\nProteins. Many edible fatty acid oils are derived from foods that\nare recognized as potent food allergens. It has been shown that\nan individual who is allergic to a food will generally not react\nto the refined oil, especially if the oil has been “hot pressed” or\nhas undergone more processing.12,13A prime example is Ara-\nchis hypogaea (peanut) oil. Peanuts are extremely allergenic to\na large population, but reaction to the oil is rare. In its safety\nassessment on A hypogaea (peanut) oil, the Panel noted that the\nmajor concern associated with allergic reactions to peanuts is\nthe protein.14The protein does not partition into the refined oil,\nand therefore, the oil is safe for use in cosmetics. However,\nresearchers have reported protein levels in processed oils. Hal-\nsey et al reported that Lowry protein determinations of cold-\npressed and refined sunflower oil were found to be 2 to 8 mg/\nmL protein,15whereas Zitouni et al reported trace amounts of\nprotein in the refined oil.16Olszewski et al found 0.1 to 0.2 mg\nprotein per gram of peanut oil,17whereas Ramazzotti et al\nreported finding immunoglobulin E (IgE)-responsive residual\nproteins in peanut oil extracts.18Porras et al found soy protein\nin some samples of soy oil, but not others.19Awazuhara et al\nreported 1.4 to 4.0 mg protein per 100 g of soy oil.20Although\nPaschke et al found approximately 35 mg/L protein content in\nrefined soybean oil, no IgE-binding activity was detectable.21\nAlthough the Panel has found a general lack of clinical\neffects for fatty acid oils already reviewed,14,22–30other groups\nhave raised concerns. The Eu ropean Medicines Agency\n(EMEA) Working Party on Herbal Medicinal Products con-\ncluded that soy and peanut products “should be treated as aller-\ngenic unless they have an analytically monitored non-\nallergenic specification and a safe maximum daily dose.”31The\nEMEA found that threshold concentrations for induction of a\nprotein contact dermatitis were not available and recom-\nmended, “all medications for topical use containing soya or\npeanut products should be treated as allergenic.”74S International Journal of Toxicology 36(Supplement 3)Aflatoxin. Aflatoxins are metabolic products of the molds Asper-\ngillus flavus andAspergillus parasiticus . They are most often\nproduced in stored agricultural crops (such as peanuts and other\nnut crops) when growth conditions and genetic requirements\nare favorable.32–34The International Agency for Research on\nCancer (IARC) categorized aflatoxins as group 1 agents,\n“carcinogenic to humans.”35,36\nThe US government places the following limitations on pea-\nnuts to be considered “negative” for aflatoxin: /C2015 ppb for\n“peanuts which have been certified as meeting edible quality\ngrade requirements” and /C2025 ppb for “nonedible quality\ncategories” (7 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) sections\n997.30 and 998.200).37Aflatoxin contamination was not a con-\ncern in the previous CIR safety assessments of peanut oil,17\nhazelnut oil,41or coconut oil.29\nGlycidol. Glycidol and glycidol fatty acid esters have been\ndetected in refined fatty acid oils.38–41\nGossypol. Gossypol reportedly is present in refined cottonseed\noil at a concentration of /C200.01%.24The concentration ofgossypol in modified cottonseed products intended for human\nconsumption is limited by federal regulation (21CFR 112.894).\nUse\nCosmetic\nThe safety of the cosmetic ingredients addressed in this safety\nassessment is evaluated based on data received from the US\nFood and Drug Administration (FDA) and the cosmetics indus-\ntry on the expected use of these ingredients in cosmetics. Use\nfrequencies of individual ingredients in cosmetics are collected\nfrom manufacturers and reported by cosmetic product category\nin the FDA Voluntary Cosmetic Registration Program (VCRP)\ndatabase. Use concentration data are submitted by the cosmetic\nindustry in response to a survey, conducted by the Personal\nCare Products Council, of maximum reported use concentra-\ntions by product category.\nThere are 244 oil ingredients included in this safety assess-\nment, 146 of which are reported to be used; 118 of the in-use\ningredients have never been reviewed by CIR, while 28 haveCrude  Oil \nDegummed Oil Lecithin Sludge \nAlkali Refined Oil Soap Stock \nSalad Oil \nCooking Oil Salad and \nCooking Oil Partially \nHydrogenated Oil \nOther Fatty Oil \nShortening \nStockBlended Oils \nMargarine Stock Bleached Oil Salad Oil Water\nAlkali \nDeodorizationDeodorization Deodorization \nDeodorization \nDeodorization \nDeodorization Activated Earth \nH2, Catalyst \nWinterization & \nDeodorization \nFigure 2.

For the ingredients being reviewed\nfor the first time, the frequency of use42and/or concentration of\nuse43–45can be found in Table 5. (Also included in Table 5 are 3\ningredients, Citrullus vulgaris (watermelon) seed oil, macada-\nmia nut oil, and Vaccinium oxycoccos (cranberry) seed oil, that\ndo not have identifiable INCI names; these ingredients are not\npart of this assessment, but they are very similar to the oils that\nare part of this assessment, and in f o r m a t i o no nt h e mi si n c l u d e di n\nthis report for completeness.) For the ingredients that have been\nreviewed previously, the current and historical23–26,28,46–48fre-\nquency and concentration of use is given in Table 6. The 97 ingre-\ndients not currently reported t o be used are listed in Table 7.42–45,49,50\nOf the oils included in this report, Bp a r k i i (shea) butter has\nthe most reported uses in cosmetic and personal care products,\nwith a total of 1,950; 1,680 of those uses are in leave-on\nformulations. A recent survey of use concentrations for B\nparkii (shea) butter reports a max imum use concentration of\n60%in leave-on products as a cu ticle softener, a manicuring\napplication.51Helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil has the\nsecond greatest number of overall uses reported, with a total\nof 1,414; 1,054 of those uses are in leave-on formulations,\nhaving use concentrations up to 96 %. Many other ingredients\nare used in an extensive number of formulations. For exam-\nple, prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil, O europaea\n(olive) fruit oil, and Gs o j a (soybean) oil have 1,127, 915, and\n912 uses, respectively. Most o f the in-use ingredients have\nuses in both leave-on and rinse-off product types, many are\nused in products that are applied around the eye and some are\nused in a way they can possibly be ingested. Some are used in\nproducts that involve mucous membrane exposure, and a few\nare used in underarm deodorant formulations. Many of the\nproducts are used in formulati ons at relatively high concen-\ntrations. Olea europaea ( o l i v e )f r u i to i li su s e da tu pt o1 0 0 %,\nPersea gratissima (avocado) oil is used at up to 98 %,H\nannuus ( s u n f l o w e r )s e e do i la tu pt o9 6 %,a n d Gs o j a (soy-\nbean) oil at 95 %.\nOils are used in a wide variety of cosmetic products for their\nskin conditioning, occlusive, emollient, moisturizing, and other\nproperties. Some of the oils included in this report are used in\nproducts that can be inhaled, and effects on the lungs that may\nbe induced by aerosolized products containing these ingredi-\nents are of concern. The particle size of aerosol hair sprays and\nof pump hair sprays is 38 and >80 mm, respectively, and is\nrelatively large compared to respirable particle sizes ( /C2010\nmm). Therefore, because of their size, most aerosol particles\nare deposited in the nasopharyngeal region and are not\nrespirable.\nNone of the oils, hydrogenate d oils, unsaponifiables, oil\nfatty acids, and salts of the fatty acids described in this report\nwere restricted from use in any way under the rules governing\ncosmetic products in the European Union.52\nNoncosmetic\nThe primary use of plant-derived fatty acid oils is for cooking.\nPalm oil is the world’s most widely consumed edible oil (41.7million metric tons), followed by soybean oil, rapeseed oil,\nsunflower seed oil, cottonseed oil, peanut oil, palm kernel oil,\ncoconut oil, and olive oil.3,53Nonfood, noncosmetic uses for\nedible fatty acid oils are found in Table 8.\nToxicological Studies\nMany of the fatty acid oils in this assessment are edible, and\nexposure to the oils from food use would result in a much larger\nsystemic dose than that resulting from use in cosmetic prod-\nucts. Consequently, their systemic toxicity potential, except as\ndiscussed below relating to carcinogenicity, is not addressed in\nthis report. The safety focus of use of these oils as cosmetic\ningredients is the potential for irritation and sensitization.\nCarcinogenicity\nThe safety of glycidol fatty acid esters in refined vegetable oils\nwas assessed by IARC. Glycidol was determined to be a group\n2A (probably carcinogenic to humans) chemical, while glyci-\nd o lf a t t ya c i de s t e r sw e r ed e t e r m i n e dt ob eag r o u p3( n o t\nclassifiable as to carcinogenicity to humans) chemical.40,41\nThe Federal Institute for Risk Assessment in Germany\nreleased a summary of their initial evaluation of the assessment\nof levels of glycidol fatty acid esters detected in refined vege-\ntable fats.39Although acknowledging that the levels of glycidol\nthat may be released from glycidol fatty acid esters are not\nknown, the evaluation noted that glycidol is classified as prob-\nably carcinogenic to humans. The evaluation was based on\nfindings of the German Chemical and Veterinary Test Agency\nthat noted that glycidol is converted to 3-chloropropanediol and\nit appeared to be the 3-chloropropanediol that was detected in\nthe vegetable fat.38The levels of 3-chloropropanediol were\nnegligible at the crude oil, degummed, neutralized, and\nbleached stages, but levels were significant at the deodorized\nstage.\nAnacardium occidentale (Cashew) Seed Oil\nThe modulatory effect of A occidentale (cashew) seed oil on\nantioxidant potential was investigated in female Swiss albino\nmice in a 120-day skin papillomagenesis study.54The mice\nwere divided into 4 groups of 15 and 1 group of 10 (vehicle\ncontrol). Test groups were as follows: group I was the vehicle\ncontrol, receiving 0.1 mL acetone; group II was the positive\ncontrol, receiving a single dose of 7,12-dimethylbenz( a)anthra-\ncene (DMBA; 0.005 mg/0.05 mL acetone) followed by appli-\ncations of 2 %croton oil 3 times a week until study termination;\ngroup III received a single dose of DMBA followed by appli-\ncations of 2.5 %cashew nut kernel oil 3 times a week until\nstudy termination; group IV received a single dose of DMBA\nfollowed by applications of 5 %cashew nut kernel oil 3 times a\nweek until study termination; and group V received 5 %cashew\nnut kernel oil applied until study termination. The oil was\napplied to the clipped dorsal scapular region that was 2 cm in\ndiameter. Body weights were recorded at regular intervals.76S International Journal of Toxicology 36(Supplement 3)Table 5.

Elaeis guineensis (palm) oil, 5%,\nwas nonallergenic in a maximization study23\nGossypium herbaceum (cotton) seed oil\nCosmetic formulations containing 3.4% to 8.97% hydrogenated cottonseed oil were not irritating to rabbit skin24\nOryza sativa (rice) bran oil\nUndiluted Oryza sativa (rice) bran oil was not irritating to rabbits, and in a guinea pig maximization study, no reactions were observed\nwhen 5% was used at induction and 25% and 50% Oryza sativa (rice) bran oil were used at challenge. An Oryza sativa (rice) bran oil/\nOryza sativa (rice) germ oil mixture, concentrations not stated, did not cause a contact allergy response. Undiluted hydrolyzed rice\nprotein was also not irritating or sensitizing25\nOryza sativa (rice) germ oil\nOryza sativa (rice) germ oil was not a primary dermal irritant25\nPrunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil\nUndiluted prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil and 2 moisturizer formulations, each containing 25% prunus amygdalus dulcis\n(sweet almond) oil, were tested for skin irritancy in rabbits using occlusive patches. Undiluted prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet\nalmond) oil was nonirritating (primary irritation index, PII ¼0/4). The formulations containing 25% prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet\nalmond) oil were minimally irritating (PIIs ¼0.28 and 0.72, respectively).\nIn a 60-day cumulative irritation test, 10% and 100% prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil was applied to rabbits. When tested\nin 7 separate trials, 100% prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil produced mean maximum irritation indices (MMIIs) ranging\nfrom 0.34 to 1.34 (maximum score ¼8). At a concentration of 10%, MMIIs for this ingredient ranged from 0 to 0.66. Results\nindicated that, when applied to the skin over a long period of time, prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil is slightly irritating;\nwhereas at 10%, it is practically nonirritating\nA maximization assay was used to determine the sensitizing potential of prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil using guinea\npigs. Intradermal induction used concentrations of 5% amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil, the dose-range phase of the\nexperiment used a single dermal application of 5%, 10%, or 100% Prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil, a booster induction\ninjection of 100% Prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil was applied occlusively for 48 hours 1 week later, challenge was\nwith 5% prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil in petrolatum applied topically under occlusion for 24 hours. Prunus amygdalus\ndulcis (sweet almond) oil was nonsensitizing\nUndiluted prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil was tested for irritancy in groups of 6 male albino rabbits. The test material\nwas applied under occlusion to the clipped intact and abraded dorsal skin of each animal. Twenty-three hours later, patches were\nremoved; sites were scored at 24 and 48 hours. The primary irritation indices (PIIs) for 7 test samples of prunus amygdalus dulcis\n(sweet almond) oil ranged from 0 to 0.18 (maximum score ¼8), indicating that this ingredient is practically nonirritating to skin208\n(continued)Burnett et al 95Sguinea pig skin, and 5 %aqueous solutions of a bar soap con-\ntaining 13 %sodium cocoate had irritation scores of 1.6 to 4.0\nof 8 in animal studies. However, the majority of the remaining\nanimal irritation and/or sensitization studies conducted on a\nlarge number of the oils included in this report, primarily in\nformulation, did not report any significant irritation or sensiti-\nzation reactions, indicating that refined oils derived from plants\nare not dermal irritants or sensitizers. None of the tested oils,\nincluding B parkii (shea) butter (up to 20 %) and Oryza sativa\n(rice) germ oil ( /C2075%), were phototoxic in animal studies. The\ncomedogenicity of C avellana (hazel) seed oil was evaluated\nusing rabbits, and a slight difference in the number and size of\nthe pilosebaceous follicles and a slight excess of sebum and a\ndilation of the follicles were observed.\nHuman\nPlant-derived fatty acid oils are commonly believed to be safe\nfor use on the skin.6de Groot notes that no documentation\nexists to show that high-quality edible lipids cause adverse\nreactions in normal individuals (except for potential comedo-\ngenicity).55Very few reports of adverse reactions to cosmetic\nuse of edible fatty acid oils have been reported.\nMany plant-derived fatty acid oils are derived from foods\nthat are recognized as potent food allergens. The allergic reac-\ntions are thought to be caused by the proteins present in the\nfood. It has been shown that an individual who is allergic to a\nfood will generally not react to the refined oil, especially if theoil has been “hot pressed” or has undergone more process-\ning.12,13In its safety assessment on A hypogaea (peanut) oil,\nthe Panel noted that while peanuts are extremely allergenic to a\nlarge population, reaction to the oil is rare. The major concern\nassociated with allergic reactions to peanuts is the protein,14\nwhich does not partition into the refined oil; therefore, the oil is\nsafe for use in cosmetics. Crevel et al also concluded that\nchemically refined peanut oil is safe for the majority of peanut\nallergic individuals.13They stated that “as peanut is acknowl-\nedged to be one of the most potent food allergens, it is reason-\nable to extrapolate the conclusions drawn up for peanut oil to\nother edible oils.” However, they concede that validated ana-\nlytical methodology for establishing the protein content of oil is\nneeded.\nIn support of the conclusions stated earlier, Crevel et al also\nexamined the allergenicity of some other oils. Very few\ninstances of allergic reactions to other major edible fatty acid\noils have been reported. Even sesame oil, which differs from\nthe other oils, is used as a flavorant and, therefore, is not\nrefined, is expected to contain significantly more protein than\nthe other edible fatty acid oils, and has had very few reports of\nallergic reaction. Additional studies demonstrating safety are\nsummarized later in this section.15,56\nA large number of clinical irritation and sensitization studies\nwere made available on many of the oils, primarily in formula-\ntion, and these studies are summarized in Table 11. All of the\ndata indicated that the oils were not irritants or sensitizers.\nSummary statements of human dermal studies, includingTable 10.

Although\nthe majority of the oils were nonirritating to mildly irritating, a few\nstudies indicated some significant irritation. For example, a lotion\ncontaining 1.5 %E guineensis (palm) oil was moderately irritating\nto rabbit eyes, and a mascara containing 9.4 %Linum usitatissimum\n(linseed) seed oil was predicted to be moderately irritating in an\nalternative assay. Available ocu lar irritation studies are summar-\nized in Table 13. Summary statements of ocular irritation studies\nfrom previous CIR reports on oils are provided in Table 14.\nHuman\nIn clinical ocular irritation studies, formulations containing\n9.4%L usitatissimum (linseed) oil and 0.2 %Ribes nigrum\n(blackcurrant) seed oil did not produce adverse reactions and\nwere considered safe for contact lens wearers. These studies are\nalso summarized in Table 13.\nClinical Studies\nClinical Trials/Case Studies\nPlant-derived fatty acid oils have been used as vehicles for\ndelivery of therapeutic agents or used alone in treating skin\ndisorders. Adverse reactions to the oils were notably absentin such clinical tests. Case studies have reported isolated aller-\ngic reactions. The available data are summarized in Table 15.\nSummary\nThe report addresses the safety of plant-derived fatty acid oils.\nThese oils, which are derived from vegetable and fruit plants,\nare composed of monoglycerides, diglycerides, and primarily\ntriglycerides, free fatty acids, and other minor components,\nincluding natural antioxidants and fat-soluble vitamins. The\npercentage of chemical constituents and nutritional content of\nindividual oil types is dependent on region where the oil plant\nis grown, individual cultivars, and plant genetics. Oils used in\ncosmetics are likely produced in the same manner as those used\nin the food industry. Oils may be expressed through mechanical\nor solvent extraction. The oils may undergo further refining,\nsuch as neutralizing, bleaching, and deodorizing, to remove pig-\nments, odors, unsaponifiable materials, and other undesirables.\nSo that all plant-derived fatty acid oils that are cosmetic\ningredients are included in 1 report, several ingredients that\nhave been reviewed previously by the Panel are included in\nthis report. The ingredients, their conclusions, and citations are\nfound in Table 2. Some study results utilized in those previous\nsafety assessments were also utilized in this safety assessment\nand cited below where appropriate.\nIndividuals who have food allergies to a plant protein rarely\nexhibit allergic reactions when exposed to refined oils of the\nsame plant. Data evaluation by the Panel regarding the method\nof manufacture indicates that protein constituents do not parti-\ntion into the refined oils. The Panel has also found a general lack\nof clinical effects for fatty acid oils that they have already\nreviewed; however, other researchers have raised concerns about\nthe presence of residual proteins in oils, such as peanut and soy.Table 11.

Cosmetic formulations\ncontaining 10.6% to 20.86% hydrogenated cottonseed oil were not irritating or sensitizing.24\nOryza sativa (rice) bran oil\nRice is generally regarded as hypoallergenic, although some case studies of allergic reactions to raw rice have been reported. In\nclinical testing, formulations containing 1.04% to 8.0% Oryza sativa (rice) bran oil were not irritating or sensitizing. Hydrolyzed rice\nprotein was not irritating to human participants.25\nPersea gratissima (avocado) oil\nPersea gratissima (avocado) oil was not an irritant or sensitizer when human participants were patch tested with cosmetic\nformulations containing up to 10.7% Persea gratissima (avocado) oil or in patch tests using 100% Persea gratissima (avocado) oil.27\nPrunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil\nUndiluted Prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil was nonirritating in a single insult patch test with 101 participants, and it was\nnonirritating and nonsensitizing in an HRIPT using 52 participants. Cosmetic formulations containing 0.1% to -5% were practically\nnonirritating and nonsensitizing in HRIPTs performed with 6,906 participants.

The safety focus of use\nof these oils as cosmetic ingredients is on the potential for\nirritation and sensitization. Undiluted, technical grade, A hypo-\ngaea (peanut) oil was moderately irritating to rabbits and gui-\nnea pig skin, and 5 %aqueous solutions of a bar soap containing\n13%sodium cocoate had irritation scores of 1.6 to 4.0 of 8 in\nanimal studies. However, the majority of the remaining animal\nirritation and/or sensitization studies conducted on a large num-\nber of the oils included in this report, primarily in formulation,\ndid not report any significant irritation or sensitizationreactions, indicating that refined oils derived from plants are\nnot dermal irritants or sensiti zers. None of the tested oils,\nincluding B parkii (shea) butter (up to 20 %) and O sativa (rice)\ngerm oil ( /C2075%), were phototoxic in animal studies. The\ncomedogenicity of C avellana (hazel) seed oil was evaluated\nusing rabbits, and a slight difference in the number and size of\nthe pilosebaceous follicles and a slight excess of sebum and a\ndilation of the follicles were observed.\nThe results of a large number of clinical irritation, sensitiza-\ntion, and photoxicity/photosensitziation studies indicated that\nplant-derived fatt acid oils were not irritants or sensitizers in\nhumans. In clinical testing with an eye mask containing 0.2 %\nRibes nigrum (blackcurrant) seed oil (undiluted), the formula-\ntion was noncomedogenic.Table 14.

An eye mask containing 0.2 %R nigrum (black-\ncurrant) seed oil (undiluted) was tested and considered safe for\ncontact lens wearers.\nPlant-derived fatty acid oils have been used as vehicles for\ndelivery of therapeutic agents or used alone in treating skin\ndisorders. Adverse reactions to the oils were notably absentin such clinical tests. Case studies have reported isolated aller-\ngic reactions.\nDiscussion\nPlant-derived fatty acid oils, oils which have been hydroge-\nnated to reduce or eliminate unsaturation, fatty acid salts, and\noil unsaponifiables were reviewed by the Panel. Most of these\ningredients in this report are mixtures of triglycerides contain-\ning fatty acids and fatty acid derivatives, the safety of which in\ncosmetics has been established. Upon review of these ingredi-\nents, the Panel expressed concern regarding gossypol (for\ncotton-derived ingredients), pesticide residues, and heavy\nmetals that may be present in botanical ingredients. The Panel\nstressed that the cosmetics industry should continue to use theTable 15. (continued)\nIngredient Patients/condition Effect/observation Reference\nOlea europaea (olive) fruit oil\nOlea europaea (olive) fruit oil Throughout the literature, it is stated that sensitization to\nOlea europaea (olive) fruit oil is considered rare. Case\nreports have been described, however, and generally\ninvolved patients with venous eczema, some type of\ndermatitis or lesion, or an occupational exposure. Patch\ntesting with Olea europaea (olive) fruit oil produced positive\nreactions in most of these cases, and these results were\nusually regarded as allergenic. The concentrations of Olea\neuropaea (olive) fruit oil tested were not always given, but,\nwhen stated, test concentrations giving positive results,\nranged from 30% to100%. When the constituents of olive oil\nwere tested as well, the results of that testing were negative.318–325\nOlea europaea (olive) fruit oil Whether the reactions to olive oil were contact\nsensitization or irritation were investigated using open and\nocclusive testing. It was concluded that olive oil presented as\na weak irritant rather than a contact sensitizer in the few\ncase studies was observed.326\nPersea gratissima (avocado) oil\nPersea gratissima (avocado)\noil1 female; dermatitis around the\neyes and earlobesPatch testing with her sunscreen resulted in positive results. In\nsubsequent patch testing of the ind ividual ingredients, a positive\nreaction to undiluted oil, but not to the active ingredient, was\nobserved; 20 control participants were involved, and reactions\ntoPersea gratissima (avocado) oil were not seen.327\nSesamum indicum (sesame) seed oil\nSesamum indicum (sesame)\nseed oil in an ointmentFemale Pruritic erythema, papules, and vesicles appeared after\napplication of the ointment; patch testing was performed\nwith the ointment and with the individual ingredients,\nincluding undiluted Sesamum indicum (sesame) seed oil.\nBoth the ointment and Sesamum indicum (sesame) seed oil\nproduced positive reactions on days 2, 3, 4, and 1; the other\ncomponents did not cause a reaction.\nResults were negative in patch testing of Sesamum indicum\n(sesame) seed oil using 20 healthy participants.328\nAbbreviations: IgE, immunoglubulin E; IgG4, immunoglobulin G4.114S International Journal of Toxicology 36(Supplement 3)necessary procedures to limit these impurities in the ingredient\nbefore blending into cosmetic formulations.\nAdditionally, the Panel considered the safety of glycidol\nand glycidol fatty acid esters in refined vegetable oils.\nAlthough the Panel recognizes that these impurities may be\ncarcinogenic, absorption through the skin would be very low\nand likely does not pose a significant hazard. Nonetheless,\nsuppliers should take steps to eliminate or reduce the presence\nof glycidol and glycidol fatty acid esters in plant-based fatty\nacid oils that are used in cosmeti c products. Aflatoxins, which\nare potent carcinogens, may be present in moldy nuts and\ncoconut copra but are not found i no i l se x p r e s s e df r o mt h e s e\nnuts and copra. The Panel adopted the US Department of\nAgriculture designation of /C2015 ppb as corresponding to\n“negative” aflatoxin content.\nCertain plant-derived oils are used in cosmetic products that\nmay be inhaled during their use. In practice, however, the par-\nticle sizes produced by the cosmetic aerosols are not respirable.\nThe Panel discussed the relationship between food allergies\nand exposure to refined oils. Individuals who have food aller-\ngies to a plant protein rarely exhibit allergic reactions when\nexposed to refined oils of the same plant. The Panel has found a\ngeneral lack of clinical effects for plant-derived fatty acid oils\nalready reviewed.\nFatty acid composition data were available for the majority\nof the oils included in this review and the Panel agreed that the\ncomposition data, in combination with the available data on\nmethod of manufacture, impur ities, safety test data, a long\nhistory of safe use in foods, and an absence of adverse reactions\nin clinical experience, were a sufficient basis for determining\nsafety. The Panel did note that vegetable oil is a blend of a\nnumber of different oils and that a specific composition of\nvegetable oil was not available. The Panel determined that the\nsafety of vegetable oil as used in cosmetic formulations has\nbeen established, providing t hat the blend contains oils for\nwhich the fatty acid composition is known.\nAdditionally, although data on th e fatty acid composition of\nFragaria vesca (strawberry) seed oil and Fragaria virginiana\n(strawberry) seed oil were not available, data were available for\nFragaria ananassa (strawberry) seed oil and Fragaria chiloensis\n(strawberry) seed oil. In that the fatty acid compositions of F ana-\nnassa andF chiloensis (strawberry) seed oil were similar to each\nother and it was assumed that Fv e s c a andF virginiana (strawberry)\nseed oils would also have similar fatty acid compositions.\nThe Panel also noted that arachidonic acid is a fatty acid\nconstituent of Lycium barbarum seed oil, O sativa (rice) germ\noil, and Sclerocarya birrea seed oil. Although a previously\npublished CIR evaluation concluded that insufficient data exist\nto support the safety of arachidonic acid in cosmetic products,\nthe Panel was of the opinion that the concentration of use of\nthese ingredients was sufficiently low that the amount of free\narachidonic acid from these oils would not warrant concern.\nFinally, the conclusion reached by the Panel on the safety of\nthe plant-derived fatty acid oils supersedes the 2001 conclusion\nof insufficient data for Corylus americana and C avellana\n(hazel) seed oil.Conclusion\nThe Panel concluded that the 244 plant-derived fatty acid oils\nincluded in this review are safe in the present practices of use\nand concentration described in this safety assessment. Were\ningredients not in current use (as indicated by *) to be used\nin the future, the expectation is that they would be used in\nproduct categories and concentrations comparable to others\nin this group.

Alan Andersen4\nAbstract\nPEGylated oil is a terminology used to describe cosmetic ingredients that are the etherification and esterification products of\nglycerides and fatty acids with ethylene oxide. The Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel (Panel) considered the safety of\nPEGylated oils, which function primarily as surfactants in cosmetic products. The Panel reviewed relevant animal and human data\nprovided in this safety assessment and concluded that the 130 chemically related PEGylated oils were safe as cosmetic ingredients\nin the present practices of use and concentration when formulated to be nonirritating.\nKeywords\nPEGylated oils, cosmetics, safety\nIntroduction\nIn 1997, the Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) published\nthe safety assessment on polyethylene glycol (PEG)-30, -33,\n-35, -36, and -40 castor oil and PEG-30 and -40 hydrogenated\ncastor oil with the conclusion ‘‘PEG-30, -33, -35, -36, and -40\ncastor oil are safe for use in cosmetics at concentrations up to\n50%a n dt h a tP E G - 3 0a n d- 4 0h y d r o g e n a t e dc a s t o ro i la r es a f e\nfor use at concentrations up to 100 %.’’1Because there are a large\nnumber of oils in this group and multiple PEG chain lengths,\nthe shorthand terminology ‘‘PEGylated oils’’ is used to describe\ncosmetic ingredients that are the etherification and esterification\nproducts of glycerides and fatty acids with ethylene oxide.\nSince the original review, numerous additional studies were\npublished related to the noncosmetic use of PEG-35 castor oil\nand PEG-40 hydrogenated castor oil (trade names Cremophor\nEL and Cremophor RH, respectively) in drug delivery systems.\nThe few of these studies that appear relevant to assessing the\nsafety of the group of PEGylated oils in cosmetics are summar-\nized in this safety assessment . Overall, single-dose and\nrepeated-dose toxicity, reproductive and developmental toxi-\ncity, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, dermal and ocular irritation,\nand sensitization and photosensitization data were available.\nBecause of similarities in chemical structure and cosmetic\nfunction, the PEGylated oils listed in Table 1 have been added\nto the safety assessment of PEG-30 castor oil to comprise a\ngroup of 130 cosmetic ingredients. These cosmetic ingredients\ninclude components that have been previously reviewed and\nconcluded to be safe for use by the CIR Expert Panel, most\nnotably the recent safety assessments on plant-derived fattyacid oils, PEGs with an average of 4 moles of ethylene oxide\nor greater, and alkyl PEG ethers. The ingredients, their conclu-\nsions, a summary of the findings, and published citations are\nfound in Table 2.\nChemistry\nThe definitions of the PEGylated oils can be found in Table 3.\nJust as oils and other PEGylated materials are mixtures,\nPEGylated oils are also mixtures. As most natural source oils\nare primarily triglycerides (and mono- and diglycerides) and\nfatty acids, PEGylated oils are primarily PEGylated glycerides,\nalong with some PEGylated fatty acids. PEGylation of glycer-\nides occurs not only as an etherification of the free alcohol\ngroups of the glycerides with ethylene oxide groups but also\nas a transesterification, which results in net insertion of PEG\ngroups between the glyceryl and fatty acid components of the\nglyceride.2,3For example, the primary component of castor oil,\nthe ricinoleate triglyceride, is ethoxylated as shown in Figure 1,\nwherein n is equal to the number of ethylene oxide repeat units\n1Cosmetic Ingredient Review Scientific Analyst/Writer, Washington, DC, USA\n2Cosmetic Ingredient Review Chemist, Washington, DC, USA\n3Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel Member, Washington, DC, USA\n4Former Director, Cosmetic Ingredient Review, Washington, DC, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nLillian J.

It should\nbe noted that n is not equal to X. In other words, wherein the\nvalue of X in PEG-X is equal to 2 (eg, PEG-2 castor oil), n is\nnot equal to 2. Instead, X represents the number of stoichio-\nmetric equivalents of ethylene oxide that were added to one\nstoichiometric equivalent of castor oil. Therefore, the sum of\nall of the different n values in the mixture may be no more than\nX. Indeed, when 1 mole of ethylene oxide is reacted with 1\nmole of fatty alcohol, adducts having noadded ethylene oxide\nare the predominate material in the mixture.2Furthermore,\nwhen ethylene oxide reacts with castor oil it is approximately\ntwice as likely that it will react at an ester site versus an alcohol\nsite. Moreover, a percentage (13 %in one specific case) of the\nethylene oxide simply reacts with other molecules of ethylene\noxide, resulting in some PEGs unattached to glycerides or acid\ngroups.\nWhile castor oil triglycerides are primarily (approximately\n87%) composed of ricinoleic acid residues, approximately 7 %\nare oleic acid, 3 %are linoleic acid, 2 %are palmitic acid, 1 %\nare stearic acid, and a trace are dihydroxysteric acid.1Thus,\nthese PEGylated castor oil ingredients, and all of the PEGy-\nlated oil ingredients, are rather complex mixtures of structu-\nrally related molecules.\nThe available free fatty acids found in castor oil, and the\nother oils, may also be esterified by the ethoxylation process, as\nseen in Figure 2 (and etherified with ethylene oxide groups if\nthere are any reactive alcohol functionalities on the fatty acids).\nSome of the ingredients in this report have been hydrogenated.\nFor example, hydrogenation of castor oil primarily results in the\nreduction of the O-9 unsaturation of ricinoleate triglycerides (and\ntheO-9 unsaturation of any free ricinoleic fatty acids).2Accord-\ningly, hydrogenated castor oil is principally 12-hydroxystearic\ntriglyceride. The resultant ethoxylated triglyceride, therefore, dif-\nfers from that of PEGylated nonhydrogenated castor oil only in\nthe loss of these double bonds, as seen in Figure 3.\nPhysical and Chemical Properties\nPhysical and chemical properties of PEG-30, -33, -35, -36, -40\ncastor oil and PEG-30 and -40 hydrogenated castor oil can be\nfound in the original safety assessment.1A supplier reports that\nPEG-30,-35, and -40 are pale yellow viscous liquids at 30/C14Cand have a maximum water content of 0.2 %.4PEG-40 hydro-\ngenated castor oil is reported to be a waxy liquid at 30/C14C and\nalso has a maximum water content of 0.2 %.\nImpurities\nSince PEGs are the condensation products of ethylene oxide\nand water, with the chain length controlled by number of moles\nof ethylene oxide that are polymerized, they may contain trace\namounts of 1,4-dioxane, a by-pr oduct of ethoxylation. 1,4-\nDioxane is a known animal carcinogen.5The Food and Drug\nAdministration (FDA) has been periodically monitoring the\nlevels of 1,4-dioxane in cosmetic products, and the cosmetic\nindustry reported that it is aware that 1,4-dioxane may be an\nimpurity in PEGs and, thus, uses additional purification steps to\nremove it from the ingredient before blending into cosmetic\nformulations.6,7\nUse\nCosmetic\nTable 4 presents the historical and current product formulation\ndata for PEG-30, -33, -35, -36, and -40 castor oil and PEG-30\nand -40 hydrogenated castor oil. These PEGylated castor oils\nfunction primarily as surfactants (emulsifying or solubilizing\nagents) in cosmetic formulations.8According to the informa-\ntion supplied to FDA Voluntary Cosmetic Registration Pro-\ngram (VCRP) database by industry in 1997, PEG-40\nhydrogenated castor oil had the most uses at 268, with the\nmajority of the uses reported in leave-on products with a der-\nmal exposure route.1The ingredient with the second most uses\nwas PEG-40 castor oil with 170 uses, most in leave-on products\nwith a dermal exposure route. An industry survey reported use\nconcentrations for PEG-40 hydrogenated castor oil and PEG-\n40 castor oil of /C2010%and/C205%, respectively. Currently, the\nFDA’s VCRP database indicates that uses have decreased for\nPEG-30 castor oil, PEG-40 castor oil, and PEG-30 hydroge-\nnated castor oil, with the most significant decrease occurring\nfor PEG-40 castor oil, which now has 95 reported uses.9\nIncreases in use are reported for the remaining PEGylated cas-\ntor oils from the original report. The most significant increase\nis for PEG-40 hydrogenated castor oil, which now has 2107\nreported uses (up from 268 uses). In a recent survey of use\nconcentrations, PEG-40 hydrogenated castor oil had a maxi-\nmum use concentration range of 7.0 /C210/C05%to 22%, with\n22%reported in leave-on noncoloring hair products.10PEG-30\ncastor oil had a maximum use concentration of 0.1 %in a rinse-\noff noncoloring hair product.\nTable 5 presents the current product formulation data for the\ncosmetic ingredients that were added to the PEGylated oil\nsafety assessment, and Table 6 lists the ingredients not reported\nto be used. Currently, the VCRP database indicates that, of the\nadditional ingredients, PEG-60 hydrogenated castor oil has the\nmost uses (349) with the majority in leave-on products with a\ndermal exposure route.9The maximum use concentration rangeTable 1.

Summaries of Previous CIR Safety Assessments.\nIngredients Conclusion Summary Reference\nPEGylated castor oils PEG-30, -33, -35, -36, and -40\ncastor oil are safe for use in\ncosmetics at concentrations\nup to 50% and PEG-30 and -40\nhydrogenated castor oil are\nsafe for use at concentrations\nup to 100%PEG castor oils and PEG hydrogenated castor oils are used\nas skin-conditioning agents and as surfactants (emulsifying\nand/or solubilizing agents). Results from animal studies\nindicate very high acute LD 50values. Repeated exposure\nstudies of PEG-30 castor oil and PEG-35 castor oil with\nintravenous exposure of 0.5 mL/kg produced some evi-\ndence of toxicity in dogs, but intramuscular injection with\n1 mL of 50% PEG-35 castor oil and oral studies with up to\n5% PEG-40 castor oil and PEG-40 hydrogenated castor oil\nwere negative. No ocular irritation was observed in\nstudies in rabbits. Some irritation was observed in animals\nwhen applied undiluted, but no sensitization was found on\nchallenge in guinea-pig studies using up to 50% PEG-35\ncastor oil. No evidence of developmental toxicity was\nseen in mice and rat feeding studies at up to 100 000 ppm.\nThese ingredients, tested as vehicle controls, produced\nno mutagenic or carcinogenic effect. Clinical data were\ngenerally negative for irritation and sensitization.1\nRicinus communis (castor) oil and\nhydrogenated castor oilSafe for use in cosmetics in the\npresent practices of use and\nconcentrationCastor oil, its salts, and esters function primarily as skin-\nconditioning agents, emulsion stabilizers, and surfactants\nin cosmetics. The principle component of castor oil, rici-\nnoleic acid, penetrated rat skin at only 5% of applied\nmaterial. These ingredients are not acute or repeated-\ndose toxicants at concentrations up to 10%. Undiluted\ncastor oil was an irritant in several animal studies. Castor\noil was not genotoxic in bacterial (up to 10 000 mg/plate)\nor mammalian test systems (up to 10%). No dose-related\nreproductive toxicity was found in mice fed up to 10%\ncastor oil for 13 weeks. Castor oil is not a significant skin\nirritant, sensitizer, or photosensitizer in human clinical\ntests, but it was a mild ocular irritant.39\nPlant-derived fatty acid oils Safe for use in cosmetics in the\npresent practices of use and\nconcentrationOils are used in a wide variety of cosmetic products for their\nskin conditioning, occlusive, emollient, and moisturizing\nproperties. Undiluted, technical grade, Arachis hypogaea\n(peanut) oil was moderately irritating to rabbits and\nguinea pig skin, and 5% aq solutions of a bar soap\ncontaining 13% sodium cocoate had irritation scores of\n1.6-4.0/8 in animal studies. However, the remaining animal\nand clinical irritation and/or sensitization studies\nconducted on a large number of the oils included in the\nsafety assessment report, primarily in formulation, did not\nreport any significant irritation or sensitization reactions,\nindicating that refined oils derived from plants are not\nocular or dermal irritants or sensitizers.40\nTriethylene glycol and\npolyethylene glycols\n(PEGs) /C214Safe for use in cosmetics in the\npresent practices of use and\nconcentrationPEGS function primarily as binders, humectants, and solvents\nin cosmetic ingredients. In general, PEGs are not oral\ntoxicants, with acute oral LD 50values in rodents ranging\nfrom 15 to 22 g/kg. Minimal dermal irritation and\nsensitization with undiluted PEGs has been observed.\nPEGs are not genotoxic (up to *5700 mg/kg/d in a rat\ndominant lethal assay) or carcinogenic (up to 0.25 mL/wk\nin a rat subcutaneous injection study). PEGs are not\nreproductive or developmental toxicants at doses up to\n6.78 g/kg in mice. Use of antimicrobial creams with a PEG\nvehicle was associated with renal toxicity when applied to\nburned skin, but studies of extensively tape-stripped skin\ndemonstrated that the levels of PEGs that could penetrate\nin a worst case analysis are >100 times less than the renal\ntoxicity no observable effect level of 1.1 g/kg/d, providing\nan adequate margin of safety.41\n(continued)16S International Journal of Toxicology 33(Supplement 4)for PEG-60 hydrogenated castor oil was 4.0 /C210/C05%to 18%,\nwith the 18 %reported in leave-on noncoloring hair products.11\nOlive oil PEG-7 esters had the second most reported uses (97).\nThe maximum use concentration range for olive oil PEG-7\nesters was 0.05 %to 97%, with the 97 %reported in a rinse-\noff (shaving) product.In some cases, reports of uses were received from the\nVCRP, but no concentration of use data were available. For\nexample, PEG-33 castor oil is reported to be used in 41 for-\nmulations, but no use concentration data were available. In\nother cases, no reported uses were received from the VCRP,\nbut a use concentration was provided in the industry survey.Table 2. (continued)\nIngredients Conclusion Summary Reference\nSimmondsia chinensis (jojoba)\nseed oilSafe for use in cosmetics in the\npresent practices of use and\nconcentrationSimmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil and the hydrogenated\noil function primarily as hair- and skin-conditioning agents.\nThe oil was not an acute oral toxicant to mice or rats\n(LD 50generally greater than 5.0 g/kg). The wax was not\ntoxic when applied dermally at doses up to 0.5 g/kg to the\nshaved backs of guinea pigs in repeated exposure tests.\nSimmondsia chinensis (Jojoba) seed oil may be a slight\nocular irritant. None of the tested ingredients were gen-\notoxic (up to 100 mg/plate) and there were no structural\nalerts for carcinogenicity. No carcinogenicity, reproduc-\ntive, or developmental toxicity data were available. In\nclinical tests, Simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil (up to\n100%) was neither a significant dermal irritant nor a sen-\nsitizer. Simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil (up to 20%)\nand jojoba alcohol (up to 100%) were not phototoxic.42\nMink oil Safe for use in cosmetics in the\npresent practices of use and\nconcentrationMink oil functions primarily as a hair-conditioning agent,\nskin-conditioning agent, and surfactant. This ingredient\ndoes not absorb significant UVA or UVB radiation. Mink\noil is not an acute oral toxicant (LD 50>6 4c m3/kg) in rats.\nNonhuman test data indicate that mink oil is not a dermal\nor ocular irritant or a dermal sensitizer up to 50%. No\nirritation was observed in clinical studies of mink oil up to\n2.8%, although some transient irritation was noted in\nexaggerated-use studies. Because mink oil is a mixture of\nglycerides, namely triglycerides, it may enhance the\npenetration of other chemicals.43\nAkyl PEG ethers Safe for use in cosmetics in the\npresent practices of use and\nconcentration when\nformulated to be nonirritatingThese ingredients primarily function in cosmetics as\nsurfactants, and some have additional functions as skin-\nconditioning agents, fragrance ingredients, and emulsion\nstabilizers. Alkyl PEG ethers are readily absorbed through\nthe skin of guinea pigs and rats and through the intestinal\nmucosa of rats, and they are quickly eliminated from the\nbody through the urine, feces, and expired air. Some alkyl\nPEG ethers, such as ceteareths and oleths, have been\nreported to enhance the penetration of certain compounds\nthrough the skin. Acute oral toxicity data were available for\nwith the LD 50ranging from 1 to >10 000 mg/kg, while der-\nmally, the data available indicated the LD 50values were\nmostly >2000 mg/kg for these families of ingredients. Mul-\ntiple repeated-dose feeding studies have been performed.\nThese ingredients were not carcinogenic at concentrations\nup to 1% in diet. Most of the alkyl PEG ethers produced\nocular irritation at concentrations of 5% and greater and\ndermal irritation at 1000 mg/kg/d and greater in studies with\nanimals; however, they were not sensitizers in guinea pigs.\nThese ingredients were not reproductive or developmental\ntoxicants and were not genotoxic in in vivo or in vitro\nassays. In clinical studies, many of the alkyl PEG ethers\nwere irritants but not sensitizers.44\nAbbreviations: aq, aqueous; CIR, Cosmetic Ingredient Review; LD 50, median lethal dose; PEG, polyethylene glycol; UV, ultraviolet.Burnett et al 17STable 3.

The volume of distribution at\nsteady state was 9.48 +2.59 L and indicated limited distribu-\ntion of the excipient outside of the central compartment.

The other values\nwere similar. The study concluded that use of PEG-35 castor oil\nas a formulation vehicle could result in drug interaction and\nexcipient-related toxic side effects due to its relatively low\nrates of elimination.\nPenetration Enhancement\nA study of the development of a topical gel for treatment of\nacne vulgaris reports that various types of PEGs are hydro-\nphilic penetration enhancers and are used in topical derma-\ntological preparations.17The authors selected PEG-40\nhydrogenated castor oil because of its properties as a veryhydrophilic, nonionic solubilizer for fat-soluble vitamins A,\nD, E, and K, and for its stability and clarity in alcohol\nsolution.\nIn a study evaluating vehicle effects on in vitro skin permea-\ntion of model drugs, caffeine and testosterone, apricot kernel\noil PEG-6 esters facilitated the flux and diffusivity of caffeine\nacross the stratum corneum, when compared to propylene\nglycol.25\nToxicological Studies\nAcute Toxicity\nDermal and oral acute toxicity data were available from earlier\nCIR safety assessments supporting the safety of alkyl PEG\nethers and castor oil.

The positive controls we re 9-aminoacridine, sodium\nazide, 2-(2-furyl)-3 -(5-nitro-2-furyl)-acrylamide, and\n2-aminoanthracene. No biologically relevant increases in\nrevertant colony numbers were observed in any test strain at\nany concentration, with or without metabolic activation. Con-\ntrols yielded expected results. The study concluded that PEG-\n60 hydrogenated castor oil was not genotoxic.\nThe above-mentioned research study also investigated the\ngenotoxic potential of PEG-60 hydrogenated castor oil in a\nchromosome aberration study with Chinese hamster V79 cells,\nwith and without metabolic activation.32The test concentrations\nranged from 313 to 5000 mg/mL. The positive controls were\nmitomycin C and dimethylnitrosamine. The test material without\nmetabolic activation had dose-related inhibition of cell prolifera-\ntion after 24- and 48-hour treatments. With metabolic activation,\nthe test material induced only slight inhibition of cell proliferation\neven at the highest concentration after 6 hours treatment. PEG-60\nhydrogenated castor oil did not induce chromosome aberrations at\nany dose, with or without metabolic activation. The controls\nyielded expected results. The study concluded that PEG-60\nhydrogenated castor oil was not genotoxic.\nThe same study also researched the genotoxic potential of\nPEG-60 hydrogenated castor oil in a mouse micronucleus test\nusing BDF1 male and female mice.32A dose range finding\nexperiment preceded the main study. In the main study, groups\nof 5 mice of each sex received single intraperitoneal injections\nof 2000 mg/kg body weight PEG-60 hydrogenated castor oil.\nControl groups received physiological saline or mitomycin C.\nBone marrow cells were collected at 24, 48, or 72 hours. The\nnumber of micronucleated erythrocytes in 1000 polychromaticerythrocytes and the number of polychromatic erythrocytes in\n1000 erythrocytes were recorded for each mouse. In the dose\nrange-finding study, no deaths occurred. In the main study, no\ntreatment-related mortalities or clinical signs of toxicity were\nobserved. No significant increase in micronucleated polychro-\nmatic erythrocytes or significant decrease in the ratio of poly-\nchromatic to normochromatic erythrocytes were observed in\nmale or female mice that received the test material. The con-\ntrols yielded expected results.

The test sites were observed for an additional 3 days after\nthe last application. While very slight irritation was observed on\naverage at the 1-hour observation point in guinea pigs treated\nwith multiple applications with damaged skin, the average scores\nwere still in the range that was considered to indicate ‘‘no irrita-\ntion.’’ No irritation was observed in any of the single-application\nanimals or in the intact skin of the multiple-application animals.\nIt was concluded that single and multiple applications of the\nmicroemulsion that contained 20 %(w/w) PEG-35 castor oil did\nnot cause irritation effects in guinea pigs.\nPEG-40 hydrogentated castor oil. A dermal irritation test was\nperformed in mice (species and number not described) to inves-\ntigate the potential irritancy of a microemulsion that contains\n20%PEG-40 hydrogenated castor oil.23A single dose of 10 mL\nof the test microemulsion was applied to the left ear of the\nmouse. The right ear served as a control. The mice were\nobserved for development of erythema for 6 days. No signs\nof irritation were observed in the mice. The authors concludedthat the formulation containing 20 %PEG-40 hydrogenated\ncastor oil would probably not irritate human skin.\nThe dermal irritancy potentia l of a microemulsion gel sys-\ntem that contained 20.66 %PEG-40 hydrogenated castor oil as\na surfactant was studied in male albino rats using the Draize\nmethod.34Animals were divided into 3 groups of 6: a negative\ncontrol (no treatment) , a positive control (0.8 %aqueous for-\nmalin), and the test formulatio n. The rats received a dose of\n0 . 5go ft h ef o r m u l a t i o no na5 - c m2area on the shaved dorsal\nside daily for 3 consecutive days. Signs of erythema and edema\nwere monitored daily for 3 days. After 3 days, the rats were\nkilled, and skin samples were taken for histopathological exam-\nination. No signs of irritation were observed in the test formula-\ntion. The controls yielded expected results. Histopathological\nexamination found no apparent signs of skin irritation.

Groups of 6 New Zealand albino rabbits\nreceived test formulations that contained 0 %to 13%PEG-35\ncastor oil. In each rabbit, the right eye received 50 mL of the tested\nformulation, while the left eye was used as a control. The rabbits\nreceived the test formulation every 2.5 hours through a period of\n7.5 hours/d for 3 successive days and once on the fourth day. Eyes\nwere examined according to the Draize method 1 and 24 hours\nafter the last instillation. The eyelids, cornea, iris, conjunctiva,\nand anterior chamber were inspected for inflammation or other\ntoxic reactions. The eyes were then stained with fluorescein and\nexamined under ultraviolet light to verify possible corneal lesion.\nA few nanoemulsion formulations that contained up to 13.5 %\nPEG-35 castor oil were found to be nonirritating and tolerated\nwell by the rabbit eye. Cross-sections from the corneas of rabbits’\neye after application of the tested formulations together with a\ncontrol section showed that both corneal structure and integrity\nwere unaffected by treatment.\nSensitization\nSensitization data were available from earlier CIR safety\nassessments that support the safety of PEGs, mink oil, plant-\nderived fatty acid oils, and alkyl PEG ethers.

A 40-year-old female undergoing chemother-\napy treatment for breast cancer had a cutaneous lupus\nerythematous-like reaction within 24 hours of intravenous\nadministration of the drug paclitaxel that contained the diluent,\nPEG-35 castor oil.36\nWhen treatment was switched to a formulation of paclitaxel\nbound to albumin, without PEG-35 castor oil, no lupus-like\nreactions were observed. The case study concluded that PEG-\n35 castor oil induced the lupus-like reaction and suggested that\npreviously reported incidences of lupus-like reaction in che-\nmotherapy patients were from this diluent and not from the\nchemotherapeutic agent.\nPEG-7 hydrogenated castor oil. A 73-year-old male was reported\nto have an eczematous rash on the face and neck after use of a\nsunscreen lotion.37The patient was patch tested with an\nextended British Contact Dermatitis Society standard series,\nmedicament series, facial series, photoallergic series, and the\nsunscreen. A positive reaction was elicited only with the\npatient’s sunscreen, both on nonirradiated and irradiated skin.\nWhen tested with the individual ingredients of the sunscreen, a\npositive reaction occurred to 10 %PEG-7 hydrogenated castor\noil in petrolatum ( þon days 2 and 4). Negative reactions were\nobserved to the remaining sunscreen ingredients.\nPEG-60 hydrogenated castor oil. A 27-year-old male undergoing\nmaintenance chemotherapy for acute myeloblastic leukemia\ndeveloped a high-grade fever and erythroblastopenia within6 hours of after intravenous administration of the chemotherapy\ndrugs that included enocitabine.38The enocitabine product con-\ntained PEG-60 hydrogenated castor oil. When enocitabine was\nadministered alone, the same symptoms reoccurred. Coculturing\nthe patient’s bone marrow with enocitabine or PEG-60 hydro-\ngenated castor oil found significant growth inhibition of late\nerythroid progenitors in the presence of the patient’s immunoglo-\nbulin G (IgG). The researchers of the study believe that PEG-60\nhydrogenated castor oil acted as a hapten and caused the immu-\nnological suppression of the growth of erythroid progenitors\nthrough a hypersensitive reaction mediated by IgG.\nSummary\nThe review of the safety of PEG-30, -33, -35, -36, and -40 castor\noil and PEG-30 and -40 hydrogenated castor oil as used in\ncosmetics has been expanded to include additional PEGylated\ncastor oils and other PEGylated plant-derived oils. Data from the\noriginal report on the PEGylated castor oils are summarized in\nTable 2, so this section only summarizes newly identified infor-\nmation on the original ingredients and the expanded ingredients.\nJust as oils and other PEGylated materials are mixtures,\nPEGylated oils are mixtures. As most natural source oils are\nprimarily triglycerides (and mono- and diglycerides) and fatty\nacids, PEGylated oils are primarily PEGylated glycerides,\nalong with some PEGylated fatty acids.\nThe PEGs are the condensation products of ethylene oxide\nand water, with the chain length controlled by number of moles\nof ethylene oxide that are polymerized. PEGs may contain trace\namounts of 1,4-dioxane, a by-product of ethoxylation.\nThe PEGylated castor oils function primarily as surfactants\nthat function as emulsifying or solubilizing agents in cosmetic\nformulations. Of the 130 PEGylated oil ingredients described\nas cosmetic ingredients, only 35 have uses reported by either\nthe FDA’s VCRP database or the Personal Care Products\nCouncil. Current FDA data indicate that PEG-40 hydrogenated\ncastor oil has the largest number of reported uses, 2107, with a\nuse concentration range of 7.0 /C210/C05%to 22%, with the 22 %\nreported in leave-on noncoloring hair products.\nPEG-30 castor oil and PEG-40 hydrogenated castor oil may\nbe used as nonionic surfactants in oral, topical, and parenteral\ndrug delivery systems. PEGylated castor oil derivatives may\nalso be used in animal feeds and textiles. PEG-30, -33, -35, -36,\nand -40 castor oil have been approved by the FDA as indirect\nfood additives in adhesives and PEG-30 and -40 hydrogenated\ncastor oil are approved as direct and indirect food additives.\nVarious types of PEGs are hydrophilic penetration enhan-\ncers and are used in topical dermatological preparations.\nUnspecified PEG castor oil did not elicit irritation at the site\nof injection in rabbits when evaluated as a vehicle in an intra-\nvenous drug.\nThe acute toxicity of PEG-60 hydrogenated castor oil was\nevaluated in male and female Beagle dogs, male and female\ncynomolgus monkeys, male New Zealand White rabbits, male\nHartley guinea pigs, and male Sprague-Dawley rats. Toxicity,\nincluding decreased blood pressure, flush, swelling, itching,Burnett et al 35Sand increase histamine levels, was observed in dogs injected\nwith 1.25, 2.5, or 10 mg/kg of the test material. No signs of\ntoxicity were observed in monkeys, rabbits, guinea pigs, or rats.\nSeveral rat studies investigated the effects of the use of\nCremophor EL (PEG-35 castor oil) as a vehicle in intravenous\ndrugs. Effects on cardiac and skeletal function have been\nobserved at a concentration of 100 mg/L.\nThe genotoxic potential of PEG-60 hydrogenated castor oil\nwas studied in a reverse mutation test, in a chromosome aberra-\ntion study, and in a mouse micronucleus test: the studies con-\ncluded that PEG-60 hydrogenated castor oil was not genotoxic.\nA study of single and multiple applications of a microemul-\nsion that contained 20 %(w/w) PEG-35 castor oil did not cause\nirritation effects in guinea pigs. A dermal irritation test per-\nformed in mice concluded that a formulation containing 20 %\nPEG-40 hydrogenated castor oil would probably not irritate\nhuman skin. A study of the dermal irritancy potential of a\nmicroemulsion gel system in rats concluded that the test for-\nmulation containing 20.66 %PEG-40 hydrogenated castor oil\nwas not a skin irritant. Nanoemulsions containing up to 13.5 %\nPEG-35 castor oil were nonirritating in rabbit eyes.\nCase studies of adverse events occurring in patients with cancer\nwere reported following use of chemotherapy drugs that contained\nPEG-35 castor oil and PEG-60 hydrogenated castor oil. Another\ncase study reported an adverse dermatological event following use\nof a sunscreen containing PEG-7 hydrogenated castor oil.\nDiscussion\nOverall, toxicokinetics, single-dose and repeated-dose toxicity,\nreproductive and developmental toxicity, genotoxicity, carcino-\ngenicity, dermal and ocular irritation, and sensitization data were\navailable for PEG castor oils. Similarly, extensive supportive data\nexist for the components of the PEGylated oils, which are com-\nplex mixtures of the etherification and transesterifcation products\nof fatty acid glycerides and fatty acids derived from the identified\nplant source with the equivalents of ethylene oxide to reach the\ndesired PEG length. PEG compounds will be present unattached\nto glycerides or fatty acid groups. Because of this unique chem-\nistry, the Panel determined that the available data in previous\nsafety assessments of PEGs and of plant-derived fatty acids sup-\nported the safety of PEGylated oils in a ‘‘read-across’’ fashion.\nThe Panel expressed concern regarding the possible presence\nof ethylene oxide and trace amounts of 1,4-dioxane as impurities\nin any cosmetic ingredient containing a PEG moiety. They\nstressed that the cosmetic industry should continue to use the\nnecessary purification procedures to remove these impurities\nfrom the ingredient before blending it into cosmetic formulations.\nThe Panel also expressed concern regarding pesticide resi-\ndues and heavy metals that may be present in botanical ingre-\ndients. They stressed that the cosmetics industry should continue\nto use the necessary procedures to limit these impurities in the\ningredient before blending into cosmetic formulation.\nA safety assessment of diethylene glycol (aka PEG-2) has\nnot been completed. A safety assessment of the PEGs group of\ningredients, however, includes PEG-4, which was found to besafe for use in cosmetics. Since PEG-4 is a mixture that\nincludes PEG-2, PEG-2 also would be safe for use in cosmetics.\nThe Panel recognized that some of these ingredients can\nenhance the penetration of other ingredients through the skin.\nThey cautioned that care should be taken in formulating cos-\nmetic products that may combine these ingredients with any\ningredients whose safety was based on their lack of dermal\nabsorption or when dermal absorption was a concern.\nThe Panel looked at changes in the pattern of use and con-\ncentration of use since the original safety assessment of PEG\ncastor oils and noted that the earlier safety assessment had spec-\nified safe up to 50 %use concentration. As PEG castor oils and\nthe rest of the PEGylated oils are now used at concentrations\nbelow 50 %in leave-on products, the Panel determined that con-\ncentration limits need no longer be specified. Products using\nthese ingredients should be formulated to be nonirritating.\nThe Panel noted that adverse reactions have been reported\nfor PEG-35 castor oil used as a vehicle in intravenous drugs.\nBecause this route of exposure does not occur from cosmetic\nuse, the Panel considered that such data were not relevant to\nassessing the safety of the ingredient in cosmetics.\nThe Panel discussed the issue of incidental inhalation exposure\nfrom fragrance products, hair sprays, deodorants, and indoor tan-\nning preparations. There were no inhalation toxicity data avail-\nable. These ingredients are reportedly used at concentrations up to\n16%in cosmetic products that may be aerosolized (ie, cosmetic\nsprays) and in other products that may become airborne (ie, cos-\nmetic powders). The Panel noted that 95 %to 99%of droplets/\nparticles produced in cosmetic aerosols would not be respirable to\nany appreciable amount. Coupled with the small actual exposure\nin the breathing zone and the concentrations at which the ingre-\ndients are used, the available information indicates that incidental\ninhalation would not be a significant route of exposure that might\nlead to local respiratory or systemic effects. In addition, the Panel\nconsidered other data available to characterize the potential for\nPEGylated oils and related ingredients to cause reproductive,\ndevelopmental, and carcinogenic effects in animals (as described\nin the original safety assessment of PEG castor oils) and dermal\nirritation and sensitization. They noted the low systemic toxicity\nat high doses in several acute and repeat exposure studies, little or\nno irritation or sensitization in multiple tests of dermal exposure\nand in clinical studies, little or no irritation in multiple ocular tests,\nthe absence of genotoxicity in bacterial and mammalian test sys-\ntems, and no reproductive or developmental toxicity or carcino-\ngenicity in animal feeding studies. A detailed discussion and\nsummary of the Panel’s approach to evaluating incidental inhala-\ntion exposures to ingredients in cosmetic products is available at\nhttp://www.cir-safety.org/cir-findings.\nConclusion\nThe CIR Expert Panel concluded that the 130 PEGylated oil\ningredients listed subsequently are safe in the present practices\nof use and concentration in cosmetics when formulated to be\nnonirritating.

Alan Andersen4\nAbstract\nThe Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel (Panel) reviewed the safety of a-amino acids, which function primarily as hair- and\nskin-conditioning agents in cosmetic products. The safety of a-amino acids as direct food additives has been well established based\non extensive research through acute and chronic dietary exposures. The Panel focused its review on dermal irritation and\nsensitization data relevant to the use of these ingredients in topical cosmetics. The Panel concluded that a-amino acids were safe\nas cosmetic ingredients in the practices of use and concentration of this safety assessment.\nKeywords\ncosmetics, a-amino acids, safety assessment\nIntroduction\nAmino acids and their salts are widely used as cosmetic ingre-\ndients and function primarily as hair-conditioning agents and\nskin-conditioning agents (humectant and miscellaneous).\nThe 21 most common naturally occurring amino acids are\nbuilding blocks of proteins. As such, amino acids are critical to\nlife and metabolic function. Eight of these amino acids, iso-\nleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine,\ntryptophan, and valine, are essential and must be obtained\nthrough nutrients, as they cannot be synthesized by human\ncells. Because amino acids are present in all living organisms\nand their general biology is well characterized, they are not\nconsidered to pose any significant safety concern following\noral exposure, except to individuals with certain genetic dis-\norders. Accordingly, this safety assessment focuses on the basic\nchemistry, uses as cosmetic ingredients, and, because of the\nimportance for products that will be applied to the skin,\naddresses all irritation and sensitization data available on these\n21 amino acids and their simple salts. The full list of the ingre-\ndients in this report is found in Table 1.\nThe naturally occurring protein amino acids are all a-amino\nacids and, with the exception of glycine and methionine, have\nL-stereochemistry at the a-carbon. The ‘‘ L-’’ amino acids are\nconsidered Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) direct food\nadditives by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), thus\noral toxicity was not a focus for these ingredients in this\nassessment.\nMonosodium glutamate (MSG) has been reported to be\nassociated with a human condition known as ‘‘MSG symptomcomplex’’ in which symptoms such as a burning sensation of\nthe face, neck, and chest; headache; and nausea occur after\nconsumption of large amounts of this amino acid salt in some\nfoods.1-3\nA rare genetic disorder, phenylketonuria, caused by a muta-\ntion in the gene that encodes phenylalanine hydroxylase, pre-\nvents affected individuals from converting phenylalanine to\ntyrosine.4If this disorder is not detected by blood testing during\nthe first few days after birth and proper dietary management is\nnot observed, irreversible neurological effects may occur.\nChemistry\nThe definition and structure of these ingredients are presented\nin Table 2, and available information on the physical and chem-\nical properties of amino acids and their salts is presented in\nTable 3.\nThe generic term ‘‘amino acid’’ is commonly considered\nshorthand for a-amino acid. This designates a carboxylic acid\n1Scientific Analyst/Writer, Cosmetic Ingredient Review, Washington, DC,\nUSA\n2Chemist, Cosmetic Ingredient Review, Washington, DC, USA\n3Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel Member, Washington, DC, USA\n4Director, Cosmetic Ingredient Review, Washington, DC, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nLillian J. Gill, Cosmetic Ingredient Review, 1101 17th Street, NW, Suite, 412,\nWashington, DC 20036, USA.\nEmail: cirinfo@cir-safety.orgInternational Journal of Toxicology\n32(Supplement 4) 41S-64S\nªThe Author(s) 2013\nReprints and permission:\nsagepub.com/journalsPermissions.nav\nDOI: 10.1177/1091581813507090\nijt.sagepub.com\nwith an amine group on the immediately adjacent ( a) carbon as\nshown in Figure 1.\nThe ‘‘natural’’ amino acids present in proteins are all\na-amino acids, with S-stereochemistry at the a-carbon, except\nglycine and cysteine. Glycine is achiral (no stereochemistry).\nL-Cysteine actually has Rstereochemistry due to the effect of\nthe sulfur atom on application of the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules\nused to define stereochemical configuration. The chirality of\namino acids is commonly denoted by the prefixes ‘‘ D-’’ and\n‘‘L-,’’ which indicate stereochemistry analogous to the Dand\nLforms of glyceraldehyde. According to this nomenclature, all\nof the ‘‘natural’’ a-amino acids have the Lconfiguration.\nExceptions are shown in Figure 2. Additionally, all of the nat-\nural amino acids contain primary amines (ie, acids with an NH 2\ngroup pendant from the acarbon), except proline, also shown\nin Figure 2, which is a secondary amine.\nCysteine and cystine are related as thiol (reduced monomer)\nand the disulfide (oxidized dimer) forms of the same structure.\nThese 2 molecules play major roles in reversible cellular redox\nchemistry as shown in Figure 3 and can serve a similar function\nin hairdressings, such as permanent waves.\nMethod of Manufacturing\nThe most common manufacture methodology for glutamine,\nhistidine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, serine, arginine, trypto-\nphan, phenylalanine, threonine, glutamic acid, and lysine is fer-\nmentation.5This method utilizes bacterial strains that\noverproduce and release, extracellularly, the desired amino acids\nduring carbohydrate metabolism. Cell separation and crystalliza-\ntion of the amino acids remove any concern of residual organ-\nisms or proteins in the end product. For example, glutamate can\nbe produced in a fermentation tank charged with a culture\nmedium including sugar and a culture of Corynebacteriumglutamicum . The extracellularly released glutamate is then sepa-\nrated from the biomass and crystallized.\nAlanine, methionine, valine, and aspartic acid, on the other\nhand, are most commonly manufactured via enzymatic cataly-\nsis.5This method utilizes active cell components in continu-\nously operating reactors. Often, these biocatalysts can be\nimmobilized to provide more efficient separations. This meth-\nodology also involves separation techniques that negate any\nconcern of organism or protein contamination in the end prod-\nuct. For example, methionine can be produced in an enzyme\nmembrane reactor with an acylase from Aspergillus oryzae and\neasily crystallized from the reaction mixture.\nCystine (and cysteine by reduction of cystine), asparagine,\nand tyrosine, however, are primarily obtained by extraction\nfrom the complete hydrolysis of proteins.5Glycine, the achiral\namino acid, is typically synthesized from chloroacetic acid and\nammonia.\nImpurities\nA supplier to the cosmetics industry reported that D-glutamic\nacid has not more than 0.3 %methanol.6\nAccording to the Food Chemic als Codex, United States\nPharmacopeia (USP)-grade amino acids (‘‘ DL-’’ and ‘‘ L-’’)\nmust be at least 98 %to 98.5%pure and contain no more than\n5m g /k gl e a d .7\nUse\nCosmetic\nThe amino acids and the salts discussed in this safety assess-\nment function primarily as hair-conditioning agents and skin-\nconditioning agents (humectant and miscellaneous) in cosmetic\nformulations.8Additional functions may include the use as oral\ncare agents (arginine), antioxidants (cysteine and cysteine\nHCl), hair waving/straightening agents (cysteine and cysteine\nHCl), reducing agents (cysteine and cysteine HCl), fragrance\ningredients (cystine), buffering agents (glycine and its calcium\nand magnesium salts), and pH adjusters (glycine and its cal-\ncium and magnesium salts).\nTable 4 presents the frequency and maximum use concen-\ntration ranges for amino acids.9,10According to information\nsupplied to the FDA by industry as part of the Voluntary Cos-\nmetic Registration Program (VCRP), arginine has the most\nreported uses in cosmetic and personal care products, with a\ntotal of 505 uses; 411 of those uses are in leave-on formula-\ntions.9Glycine has the second greatest number of overall uses\nreported, with a total of 364; 252 of those uses are in leave-on\nformulations. No uses were reported to the VCRP for sodium\naspartate, dipotassium aspartate, calcium aspartate, calcium\nglycinate, or magnesium glycinate. In a recent survey of use\nconcentrations, arginine had a maximum use concentration\nrange of 2.0 /C210/C05%to 18%, with the 18 %reported in paste\nmasks and mud packs.10Glycine had a maximum use concen-\ntration range of 5.0 /C210/C04%to 4%, with the 4 %reported inTable 1.

No use concentrations were\nreported for asparagine, sodium aspartate, dipotassium\naspartate, calcium aspartate, sodium glycinate, and magnesium\nglycinate. In some cases, reports of uses were received in the\nVCRP, but no concentration of use data were available. For\nexample, asparagine is reported to be used in 9 formulations,\nbut no use concentration data were available. In other cases, no\nreported uses were received in the VCRP, but a use concentra-\ntion was provided in the industry survey. For example, calcium\nglycinate was not reported in the VCRP to be in use, but the\nindustry survey indicated that it is used in leave-on formula-\ntions at up to 3 %. It should be presumed that calcium glycinate\nis used in at least one cosmetic formulation.\nProducts containing amino acids are reported to be used on\nbaby skin, may be applied to the eye area or mucous mem-\nbranes, or could be incidentally ingested. Additionally, amino\nacids are used in cosmetic sprays, including hair and other\npropellant and pump spray products, and could possibly be\ninhaled. The maximum concentration of amino acids reported\nto be used in a spray product is 0.3 %glycine in a face spray. In\npractice, 95 %to 99%of the droplets/particles released from\ncosmetic sprays have aerodynamic equivalent diameters >10\nmm, with propellant sprays yielding a greater fraction of dro-\nplets/particles <10 mm compared with pump sprays.11,12There-\nfore, most droplets/particles incidentally inhaled from cosmetic\nsprays would be deposited in the nasopharyngeal and bronchial\nregions and would not be respirable (ie, able to enter the lungs)\nto any appreciable amount.13,14\nNoncosmetic\nThe ‘‘ L-’’ amino acids are considered GRAS direct food addi-\ntives by the FDA and may be in the free, hydrated, or anhy-\ndrous forms or as the hydrochloride, sodium, or potassium salts\n(21 CFR §172.320). ‘‘ DL-’’ and ‘‘ L-’’ amino acids are described\nas food additives by the USP Food Chemicals Codex.7\nIn addition to food additives and supplements, amino acids\nalso may be used in the production of pesticides as source\nmaterials of chemical synthesis.15,16\nToxicological Studies\nThe amino acids in this assessment are found in foods, and the\ndaily exposure from food use would result in a much larger\nsystemic dose than that resulting from use in cosmetic products.Numerous studies and reviews have been published in the lit-\nerature about the safety of dietary exposure to amino acids,\nincluding a review by the Joint Food and Agriculture Organi-\nzation of the United Nations/World Health Organization Expert\nCommittee on Food Additives that summarized studies on oral\nacute and chronic exposure/carcinogenicity studies and geno-\ntoxicity and found no safety concerns for these substances at\nthe amounts they are used in flavoring agents.17Also, as noted\nearlier, the ‘‘ L-’’ amino acids are considered GRAS in direct\nfood additives by the FDA, and both ‘‘ DL-’’ and ‘‘ L-’’ amino\nacids are described as food additives in the USP Food Chemi-\ncals Codex. Consequently, the systemic toxicity potential is not\naddressed further in this report. The safety focus of use of these\namino acids as cosmetic ingredients is on the potential for\nirritation and sensitization.\nEnzyme Regulation\nIn an in vitro study using human keratinocytes, continuous\napplication of arginine ( L-) for 24 or 48 hours at concentrations\nof 10 to 50 mmol/L was found to increase endogenous intra-\nkeratinocytic urea synthesis through increased activity of ker-\natinocytic arginase.18\nIrritation and Sensitization\nIrritation\nDermal. Non-human irritation studies are presented in Table 5.\nThese data show tested ingredients to be nonirritating.\nOcular. Non-human and human ocular irritation studies are pre-\nsented in Table 6. The findings range from nonirritating to\nmoderately irritating.\nSensitization\nNon-human and human sensitization studies are presented in\nTable 7. No irritation was reported during induction, and no\nsensitization was reported at challenge.\nPhototoxicity\nPhototoxicity studies are presented in Table 8. No phototoxi-\ncity was reported.\nSummary\nAmino acids are critical to life and metabolic function. Because\namino acids are present in all living organisms, they are not\nconsidered to pose any significant safety concern following\noral exposure except to individuals with certain genetic disor-\nders, and their general biology is well characterized.\nThe amino acids and their salts are used primarily as hair-\nconditioning agents and skin-conditioning agents in cosmetic\nformulations. Arginine has the most reported uses in cosmetic\nand personal care products, with a total of 440. The maximumNH2O\nOHαβγ δ\nS-stereochemistry (L-)\nFigure 1. General structure for a-amino acids (see Discussion\nsection).52S International Journal of Toxicology 32(Supplement 4)use concentration range for arginine is 2.0 /C210/C05%to 18%.\nGlycine has the second greatest number of overall uses\nreported, with a total of 323, and has a maximum use concen-\ntration range of 5.0 /C210/C04%to 4%. The maximum concen-\ntration of amino acids reported to be used in a spray product is\n0.3%glycine in a face spray.\nThe ‘‘ L-’’ amino acids are considered GRAS in direct food\nadditives by the FDA. In addition to food additives and supple-\nments, amino acids may be used in the production of pesticides\nas source materials of chemical synthesis.\nAn in vitro study using human keratinocytes found that\ncontinuous application of arginine ( L-) increased endogenous\nintrakeratinocytic urea synthesis through increased activity of\nkeratinocytic arginase.\nCysteine HCl and methionine were used as negative controls\nin in vitro assays to predict potential skin irritants.\nIn separate efficacy studies, arginine, cysteine, and glycine\ndid not produce any adverse effects in rats, guinea pigs, or\nmouse skin models. Glutamic acid was used as a negative\ncontrol in an in vitro study to identify skin sensitizers.\nHuman repeat insult patch test studies of many products con-\ntaining amino acid ingredients concluded that products contain-\ning these ingredients were not dermal irritants or sensitizers.In several validation studies for in vitro phototoxicity\nassays, histidine was used as a negative control. Magnesium\naspartate up to 0.5 %and 1%tyrosine were not phototoxic in\nassays using yeast.\nDiscussion\nThe Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel (Panel)\nacknowledged that the safety of a-amino acids as direct food\nadditives has been well established based on extensive research\nthrough acute and chronic dietary exposures. The Panel deter-\nmined that this body of research, coupled with the available\nirritation and sensitization data and use concentrations that are\nat levels much lower than those consumed daily in the diet,\nwere a sufficient basis for determining the safety of a-amino\nacids in cosmetic products.\nThe Panel discussed the issue of incidental inhalation expo-\nsure from hair sprays, face and neck sprays, and suntan sprays.\nNo inhalation data were available. These ingredients reportedly\nare used at concentrations up to 0.3 %in cosmetic products that\nmay be aerosolized. The Panel noted that 95 %to 99%of dro-\nplets/particles would not be re spirable to any appreciable\namount.

The\nPanel considered other data available to characterize the\npotential for a-amino acids to cause systemic toxicity, irrita-\ntion, sensitization, or other effects. They noted that numerous\nstudies and reviews have been published in the literature\nregarding the safety of dietary exposure to amino acids,\nincluding studies on oral acut e and chronic toxicity, carcino-\ngenicity, and genotoxicity, which found no safety concerns\nfor these substances in the amounts at which they are con-\nsumed in flavoring agents. Additionally, little or no irritation\nor sensitization was observed in multiple tests of dermal and\nocular exposure. A detailed discussion and summary of the\nPanel’s approach to evaluating incidental inhalation exposuresto ingredients in cosmetic products is available at http://\nwww.cir-safety.org/cir-findings.\nThe Panel recognized that there are issues with sodium glu-\ntamate and phenylalanine in the diet for certain individuals.\nHowever, the Panel determined that the concentrations of these\namino acids in cosmetic products are at levels that would not be\nsignificantly absorbed through topical application or incidental\ningestion and, thus, would not cause systemic reactions in\nindividuals.\nAlthough the International Cosmetic Dictionary and\nHandbook does not distinguish among the a-amino acids used\nin cosmetics that are L-stereoisomers from those that are D-\nstereoisomers (or are mixtures of L-a n d D-stereoisomers), the\nPanel noted that the L-amino acids are GRAS direct food\nadditives by the FDA (except m ethionine which is GRAS as\na racemic mixture, and glycine which is GRAS and has noTable 4.

Klaassen3,\nDaniel C. Liebler3, James G. Marks Jr3, Ronald C. Shank3,\nThomas J. Slaga3, Paul W. Snyder2, and F. Alan Andersen4\nAbstract\nThe Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel (Panel) reviewed the safety of a-amino acids, which function primarily as hair- and\nskin-conditioning agents in cosmetic products. The safety of a-amino acids as direct food additives has been well established based\non extensive research through acute and chronic dietary exposures. The Panel focused its review on dermal irritation and\nsensitization data relevant to the use of these ingredients in topical cosmetics. The Panel concluded that a-amino acids were safe\nas cosmetic ingredients in the practices of use and concentration of this safety assessment.\nKeywords\ncosmetics, a-amino acids, safety assessment\nIntroduction\nAmino acids and their salts are widely used as cosmetic ingre-\ndients and function primarily as hair-conditioning agents and\nskin-conditioning agents (humectant and miscellaneous).\nThe 21 most common naturally occurring amino acids are\nbuilding blocks of proteins. As such, amino acids are critical to\nlife and metabolic function. Eight of these amino acids, iso-\nleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine,\ntryptophan, and valine, are essential and must be obtained\nthrough nutrients, as they cannot be synthesized by human\ncells. Because amino acids are present in all living organisms\nand their general biology is well characterized, they are not\nconsidered to pose any significant safety concern following\noral exposure, except to individuals with certain genetic dis-\norders. Accordingly, this safety assessment focuses on the basic\nchemistry, uses as cosmetic ingredients, and, because of the\nimportance for products that will be applied to the skin,\naddresses all irritation and sensitization data available on these\n21 amino acids and their simple salts. The full list of the ingre-\ndients in this report is found in Table 1.\nThe naturally occurring protein amino acids are all a-amino\nacids and, with the exception of glycine and methionine, have\nL-stereochemistry at the a-carbon. The ‘‘ L-’’ amino acids are\nconsidered Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) direct food\nadditives by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), thus\noral toxicity was not a focus for these ingredients in this\nassessment.\nMonosodium glutamate (MSG) has been reported to be\nassociated with a human condition known as ‘‘MSG symptomcomplex’’ in which symptoms such as a burning sensation of\nthe face, neck, and chest; headache; and nausea occur after\nconsumption of large amounts of this amino acid salt in some\nfoods.1-3\nA rare genetic disorder, phenylketonuria, caused by a muta-\ntion in the gene that encodes phenylalanine hydroxylase, pre-\nvents affected individuals from converting phenylalanine to\ntyrosine.4If this disorder is not detected by blood testing during\nthe first few days after birth and proper dietary management is\nnot observed, irreversible neurological effects may occur.\nChemistry\nThe definition and structure of these ingredients are presented\nin Table 2, and available information on the physical and chem-\nical properties of amino acids and their salts is presented in\nTable 3.\nThe generic term ‘‘amino acid’’ is commonly considered\nshorthand for a-amino acid. This designates a carboxylic acid\n1Scientific Analyst/Writer, Cosmetic Ingredient Review, Washington, DC,\nUSA\n2Chemist, Cosmetic Ingredient Review, Washington, DC, USA\n3Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel Member, Washington, DC, USA\n4Director, Cosmetic Ingredient Review, Washington, DC, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nLillian J.

Glycine is achiral (no stereochemistry).\nL-Cysteine actually has Rstereochemistry due to the effect of\nthe sulfur atom on application of the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules\nused to define stereochemical configuration. The chirality of\namino acids is commonly denoted by the prefixes ‘‘ D-’’ and\n‘‘L-,’’ which indicate stereochemistry analogous to the Dand\nLforms of glyceraldehyde. According to this nomenclature, all\nof the ‘‘natural’’ a-amino acids have the Lconfiguration.\nExceptions are shown in Figure 2. Additionally, all of the nat-\nural amino acids contain primary amines (ie, acids with an NH 2\ngroup pendant from the acarbon), except proline, also shown\nin Figure 2, which is a secondary amine.\nCysteine and cystine are related as thiol (reduced monomer)\nand the disulfide (oxidized dimer) forms of the same structure.\nThese 2 molecules play major roles in reversible cellular redox\nchemistry as shown in Figure 3 and can serve a similar function\nin hairdressings, such as permanent waves.\nMethod of Manufacturing\nThe most common manufacture methodology for glutamine,\nhistidine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, serine, arginine, trypto-\nphan, phenylalanine, threonine, glutamic acid, and lysine is fer-\nmentation.5This method utilizes bacterial strains that\noverproduce and release, extracellularly, the desired amino acids\nduring carbohydrate metabolism. Cell separation and crystalliza-\ntion of the amino acids remove any concern of residual organ-\nisms or proteins in the end product. For example, glutamate can\nbe produced in a fermentation tank charged with a culture\nmedium including sugar and a culture of Corynebacteriumglutamicum . The extracellularly released glutamate is then sepa-\nrated from the biomass and crystallized.\nAlanine, methionine, valine, and aspartic acid, on the other\nhand, are most commonly manufactured via enzymatic cataly-\nsis.5This method utilizes active cell components in continu-\nously operating reactors. Often, these biocatalysts can be\nimmobilized to provide more efficient separations. This meth-\nodology also involves separation techniques that negate any\nconcern of organism or protein contamination in the end prod-\nuct. For example, methionine can be produced in an enzyme\nmembrane reactor with an acylase from Aspergillus oryzae and\neasily crystallized from the reaction mixture.\nCystine (and cysteine by reduction of cystine), asparagine,\nand tyrosine, however, are primarily obtained by extraction\nfrom the complete hydrolysis of proteins.5Glycine, the achiral\namino acid, is typically synthesized from chloroacetic acid and\nammonia.\nImpurities\nA supplier to the cosmetics industry reported that D-glutamic\nacid has not more than 0.3 %methanol.6\nAccording to the Food Chemic als Codex, United States\nPharmacopeia (USP)-grade amino acids (‘‘ DL-’’ and ‘‘ L-’’)\nmust be at least 98 %to 98.5%pure and contain no more than\n5m g /k gl e a d .7\nUse\nCosmetic\nThe amino acids and the salts discussed in this safety assess-\nment function primarily as hair-conditioning agents and skin-\nconditioning agents (humectant and miscellaneous) in cosmetic\nformulations.8Additional functions may include the use as oral\ncare agents (arginine), antioxidants (cysteine and cysteine\nHCl), hair waving/straightening agents (cysteine and cysteine\nHCl), reducing agents (cysteine and cysteine HCl), fragrance\ningredients (cystine), buffering agents (glycine and its calcium\nand magnesium salts), and pH adjusters (glycine and its cal-\ncium and magnesium salts).\nTable 4 presents the frequency and maximum use concen-\ntration ranges for amino acids.9,10According to information\nsupplied to the FDA by industry as part of the Voluntary Cos-\nmetic Registration Program (VCRP), arginine has the most\nreported uses in cosmetic and personal care products, with a\ntotal of 505 uses; 411 of those uses are in leave-on formula-\ntions.9Glycine has the second greatest number of overall uses\nreported, with a total of 364; 252 of those uses are in leave-on\nformulations. No uses were reported to the VCRP for sodium\naspartate, dipotassium aspartate, calcium aspartate, calcium\nglycinate, or magnesium glycinate. In a recent survey of use\nconcentrations, arginine had a maximum use concentration\nrange of 2.0 /C210/C05%to 18%, with the 18 %reported in paste\nmasks and mud packs.10Glycine had a maximum use concen-\ntration range of 5.0 /C210/C04%to 4%, with the 4 %reported inTable 1.

No use concentrations were\nreported for asparagine, sodium aspartate, dipotassium\naspartate, calcium aspartate, sodium glycinate, and magnesium\nglycinate. In some cases, reports of uses were received in the\nVCRP, but no concentration of use data were available. For\nexample, asparagine is reported to be used in 9 formulations,\nbut no use concentration data were available. In other cases, no\nreported uses were received in the VCRP, but a use concentra-\ntion was provided in the industry survey. For example, calcium\nglycinate was not reported in the VCRP to be in use, but the\nindustry survey indicated that it is used in leave-on formula-\ntions at up to 3 %. It should be presumed that calcium glycinate\nis used in at least one cosmetic formulation.\nProducts containing amino acids are reported to be used on\nbaby skin, may be applied to the eye area or mucous mem-\nbranes, or could be incidentally ingested. Additionally, amino\nacids are used in cosmetic sprays, including hair and other\npropellant and pump spray products, and could possibly be\ninhaled. The maximum concentration of amino acids reported\nto be used in a spray product is 0.3 %glycine in a face spray. In\npractice, 95 %to 99%of the droplets/particles released from\ncosmetic sprays have aerodynamic equivalent diameters >10\nmm, with propellant sprays yielding a greater fraction of dro-\nplets/particles <10 mm compared with pump sprays.11,12There-\nfore, most droplets/particles incidentally inhaled from cosmetic\nsprays would be deposited in the nasopharyngeal and bronchial\nregions and would not be respirable (ie, able to enter the lungs)\nto any appreciable amount.13,14\nNoncosmetic\nThe ‘‘ L-’’ amino acids are considered GRAS direct food addi-\ntives by the FDA and may be in the free, hydrated, or anhy-\ndrous forms or as the hydrochloride, sodium, or potassium salts\n(21 CFR §172.320). ‘‘ DL-’’ and ‘‘ L-’’ amino acids are described\nas food additives by the USP Food Chemicals Codex.7\nIn addition to food additives and supplements, amino acids\nalso may be used in the production of pesticides as source\nmaterials of chemical synthesis.15,16\nToxicological Studies\nThe amino acids in this assessment are found in foods, and the\ndaily exposure from food use would result in a much larger\nsystemic dose than that resulting from use in cosmetic products.Numerous studies and reviews have been published in the lit-\nerature about the safety of dietary exposure to amino acids,\nincluding a review by the Joint Food and Agriculture Organi-\nzation of the United Nations/World Health Organization Expert\nCommittee on Food Additives that summarized studies on oral\nacute and chronic exposure/carcinogenicity studies and geno-\ntoxicity and found no safety concerns for these substances at\nthe amounts they are used in flavoring agents.17Also, as noted\nearlier, the ‘‘ L-’’ amino acids are considered GRAS in direct\nfood additives by the FDA, and both ‘‘ DL-’’ and ‘‘ L-’’ amino\nacids are described as food additives in the USP Food Chemi-\ncals Codex. Consequently, the systemic toxicity potential is not\naddressed further in this report. The safety focus of use of these\namino acids as cosmetic ingredients is on the potential for\nirritation and sensitization.\nEnzyme Regulation\nIn an in vitro study using human keratinocytes, continuous\napplication of arginine ( L-) for 24 or 48 hours at concentrations\nof 10 to 50 mmol/L was found to increase endogenous intra-\nkeratinocytic urea synthesis through increased activity of ker-\natinocytic arginase.18\nIrritation and Sensitization\nIrritation\nDermal. Non-human irritation studies are presented in Table 5.\nThese data show tested ingredients to be nonirritating.\nOcular. Non-human and human ocular irritation studies are pre-\nsented in Table 6. The findings range from nonirritating to\nmoderately irritating.\nSensitization\nNon-human and human sensitization studies are presented in\nTable 7. No irritation was reported during induction, and no\nsensitization was reported at challenge.\nPhototoxicity\nPhototoxicity studies are presented in Table 8. No phototoxi-\ncity was reported.\nSummary\nAmino acids are critical to life and metabolic function. Because\namino acids are present in all living organisms, they are not\nconsidered to pose any significant safety concern following\noral exposure except to individuals with certain genetic disor-\nders, and their general biology is well characterized.\nThe amino acids and their salts are used primarily as hair-\nconditioning agents and skin-conditioning agents in cosmetic\nformulations. Arginine has the most reported uses in cosmetic\nand personal care products, with a total of 440. The maximumNH2O\nOHαβγ δ\nS-stereochemistry (L-)\nFigure 1. General structure for a-amino acids (see Discussion\nsection).52S International Journal of Toxicology 32(Supplement 4)use concentration range for arginine is 2.0 /C210/C05%to 18%.\nGlycine has the second greatest number of overall uses\nreported, with a total of 323, and has a maximum use concen-\ntration range of 5.0 /C210/C04%to 4%. The maximum concen-\ntration of amino acids reported to be used in a spray product is\n0.3%glycine in a face spray.\nThe ‘‘ L-’’ amino acids are considered GRAS in direct food\nadditives by the FDA. In addition to food additives and supple-\nments, amino acids may be used in the production of pesticides\nas source materials of chemical synthesis.\nAn in vitro study using human keratinocytes found that\ncontinuous application of arginine ( L-) increased endogenous\nintrakeratinocytic urea synthesis through increased activity of\nkeratinocytic arginase.\nCysteine HCl and methionine were used as negative controls\nin in vitro assays to predict potential skin irritants.\nIn separate efficacy studies, arginine, cysteine, and glycine\ndid not produce any adverse effects in rats, guinea pigs, or\nmouse skin models. Glutamic acid was used as a negative\ncontrol in an in vitro study to identify skin sensitizers.\nHuman repeat insult patch test studies of many products con-\ntaining amino acid ingredients concluded that products contain-\ning these ingredients were not dermal irritants or sensitizers.In several validation studies for in vitro phototoxicity\nassays, histidine was used as a negative control. Magnesium\naspartate up to 0.5 %and 1%tyrosine were not phototoxic in\nassays using yeast.\nDiscussion\nThe Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel (Panel)\nacknowledged that the safety of a-amino acids as direct food\nadditives has been well established based on extensive research\nthrough acute and chronic dietary exposures. The Panel deter-\nmined that this body of research, coupled with the available\nirritation and sensitization data and use concentrations that are\nat levels much lower than those consumed daily in the diet,\nwere a sufficient basis for determining the safety of a-amino\nacids in cosmetic products.\nThe Panel discussed the issue of incidental inhalation expo-\nsure from hair sprays, face and neck sprays, and suntan sprays.\nNo inhalation data were available. These ingredients reportedly\nare used at concentrations up to 0.3 %in cosmetic products that\nmay be aerosolized. The Panel noted that 95 %to 99%of dro-\nplets/particles would not be re spirable to any appreciable\namount.

The\nPanel considered other data available to characterize the\npotential for a-amino acids to cause systemic toxicity, irrita-\ntion, sensitization, or other effects. They noted that numerous\nstudies and reviews have been published in the literature\nregarding the safety of dietary exposure to amino acids,\nincluding studies on oral acut e and chronic toxicity, carcino-\ngenicity, and genotoxicity, which found no safety concerns\nfor these substances in the amounts at which they are con-\nsumed in flavoring agents. Additionally, little or no irritation\nor sensitization was observed in multiple tests of dermal and\nocular exposure. A detailed discussion and summary of the\nPanel’s approach to evaluating incidental inhalation exposuresto ingredients in cosmetic products is available at http://\nwww.cir-safety.org/cir-findings.\nThe Panel recognized that there are issues with sodium glu-\ntamate and phenylalanine in the diet for certain individuals.\nHowever, the Panel determined that the concentrations of these\namino acids in cosmetic products are at levels that would not be\nsignificantly absorbed through topical application or incidental\ningestion and, thus, would not cause systemic reactions in\nindividuals.\nAlthough the International Cosmetic Dictionary and\nHandbook does not distinguish among the a-amino acids used\nin cosmetics that are L-stereoisomers from those that are D-\nstereoisomers (or are mixtures of L-a n d D-stereoisomers), the\nPanel noted that the L-amino acids are GRAS direct food\nadditives by the FDA (except m ethionine which is GRAS as\na racemic mixture, and glycine which is GRAS and has noTable 4.

The Panel rev iewed the available data to determine the safety of these ingredients , which are frequently reported to \nfunction in cosmetics as skin -conditioning agents .  Impurities, particularly arsenic, may be present in these ingredients.  \nIndustry should continue to use good manufacturing practices to monitor and  limit these possible impurities. The Panel \nconcluded  that 68 brown algae -derived ingredients are safe in cosmetics  in the present practices of use and concentration \ndescribed in this safety assessment.  The Panel also concluded that the data are insufficient to determin e the safety of the \nremaining ingredients under the intended conditions of use in cosmetic formulations.    \nINTRODUCTION  \nThis is a safety assessment  of brown algae -derived ingredients as use d in cosmetics.   The ingredients in this review \nare extracts, powders,  juices , or waters  derived from  one or multiple species of brown algae.  A total of 82 International \nNomenclature Cosmetic Ingredient (INCI)  names identifying brown algae -derived ingredi ents ( Table 1) were found in the \nDictionary ; however, several of these ingredients appear to be equivalent based on the accepted scientific name, as given in \nthe defin ition ( Table 2).1  Accordingly, the total number of distinct cosmetic ingredients is 74.  \nThese ingredients are a highly complex group, all of which are marine -derived , with intricate chemistry and \ncomplex compositions.  According to the Dictionary , these brown algae -derived ingredients are most commonly used as skin \nconditioning agents  (Table 2).1  These ingredients are also reported to be used as absorbe nts, antioxid ants, binder s, hair \nconditioning agent s, oxidizing agent s, pH adjuster s, and viscosity increasing agent s.  The safety of these ingredients was \nassessed  based on the availability of systemic toxicity data, via oral repeated dose toxicity studies, use in food, generally \nrecognized as safe ( GRAS ) status, and on studies examining potential local effects, such as sensitization.    \nThere are several major group s of algae (as described in “Algae Identification” section).  However, t his safety \nassessment focuses only on brown algae.  The names of the ingredients in this report are written in accordance with the INCI \nnaming conventions , i.e., capitalized without italics or abbreviations . When referring to the algae from which these \ningredients are derived, the standard taxonomic practice of using italics  is followed (e.g., Agarum c ribrosum ).  The term \n“kelp” is commonly used when referring to a major group of brown algae species .  Kelp are large brown algae that belong to \nthe order Laminariales.2  \nSeveral brown algae constituents, such as p hytosterols ,3 phytostery l ingredients ,3 and alginic acid4 were found to be \nsafe as used by the Panel .  The full reports on these ingredients c an be accessed on the CIR website (https://www.cir -\nsafety.org/ingredients ); therefore, information regarding these ingredients will not be included in this report.   \nThis safety assessment includes relevant published and unpublished data that are available for each endpoint that is \nevaluated.  Published data are identified by conducting an exhaustive search of the literature.  A listing of the search engines \nand websites that are used and the sources that are typically explored, as well as the endpoints that CIR typically evaluates, is provided on the CIR website ( https://www.cir -safety.org/ supplementaldoc/preliminary -search -engines -and-websites\n; \nhttps://www.cir -safety.org/supplementaldoc/cir -report -format -outline ).  Unpublished data were  provided by the cosmetics \nindustry . \nThe European Chemical Agency (ECHA)5,6 website provide s summaries of data generated by industry, and is cited \nthroughout the report as appropriate .  Also referen ced in this safety assessment are summary data found in other reports , \nincluding those  published by the  European Medicines Agency (EMA) ,7,8 the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) Panel \non Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA),9 and Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) .10,11 \nCHEMISTRY  \nDefinition s \nThe ingredients in this safety assessment are derived from variou s species of brown algae.  “Algae” is not a \ntaxonomic group, but a functional group of convenience .12  Not all a lgae should be considered to be plant -like (seaweed; \nmacroalgae) . While s ome algae are seaweed , some are protozoa, and some  are unique and belong in other kingdoms.  \nHowever , these aquatic and o xygenic organisms  are all part of the eclectic group called “ algae .”  \nAlgae  Identification  \nThere are several major groups of algae , and they  are comm only referred to as brown algae ( Phaeophyceae ), green \nalgae ( Chlorophyta), diatoms ( Bacillariophyceae ), chrysophytes  (Chrysophyta ), blue-green algae (Cyanophyta), r ed algae \n(Rhodophyta), d inoflagellates  (Pyrrhophyta), and e uglenoids  (Euglenophyta).  A description of these major algal groups can \nbe seen in Table 3.  The various  types of algae are arranged  by storage products, pigmentation, and cell wall composition .12  \nA list of the brown algae -derived ingredients , based on their corresponding subclass, order, family and genus , is presented in \nTable 4.  Brown algae are mostly comprised of large, leathery seaweeds and are clas sified in about 265 genera with, in \naggregate, more  than 1500 species.12,13  The actual color varies depending on the proportion of brown pigment (fucoxanthin) \nto green pigment (chlorophyll).   This algal group contains alginic acid and fucoidan in its complex cell walls.  General \ncharacteristics and the geographic distribution of several specific  species of brown algae included in this report are presented \nin Table 5. \nAs with plant-derived ingredients, the constituent composition of these seaweed ingredients can vary widely \ndepending on growing conditions, age of the organisms, local environmental aspects, harvesting conditions, methods of \nextraction, and many other variables.  F or example, t he concentration of the most abundant carotenoid pigment in brown \nalgae, fucoxanthin, varies remarkably depending on the age of the alga , and the protein content in brown algae varies \nconsiderably depending on the season in which it is harvest ed.14,15 \nPhysical and Chemical Properties  \nPhysical and chemical properties of Ascophyllum Nodosum  Extract, Ascophyllum Nodosum  Powder, Ecklonia \nCava  Extract , and Halidrys Siliquosa Extract (aq.)  are presented in Table 6.  Using the sieve method, 93.5% of the particle \nsizes of Ascophyllum Nodosum  Extract, as a fully dried extract, were less than 0.250 mm and greater than 0.045 mm.6   \nHarvesting  \nOriginally, t he only source  of brown algae was in the wild ; but since the mid -twentieth century , demand has \nexceeded the supply that could be harvested  from wild sources , and methods for cultivation have been developed.16  \nConsequently, t oday,  commercial  brown seaweed comes mainly from farming rather than wild  sources.   Laminari a japonica \nand Undaria pinnatifida are among the most cultivated species of brown algae.17  Several species, such as Laminaria \njaponica , are grown on suspended ropes in the ocean.16  Repeated harvesting of Macrocystis pyrifera  over a 3 -month period  \ndid not significantly impact tissue chemical properties (i.e. alginate yield ; viscosity and strength; nutritional qu ality, such as \nprotein, carbohydrate, lipid, crude fiber, ash, and energy content ; and tissue carbon/nitrogen ratios).18 \nMethod of Manufacture  \nNumerous  methods of manufacture are provided in Table 7.   Several of the se method s have  a target constituent or \ncomposition  (e.g., high in fucoidan) . The characterization of the final extract  is provided in the table .  A general overview of \na method of manufacture for the relevant brown algae -derived ingredients can be seen in Figure 1.  \nArsenic is a constituent of concern in certain brown algae [see Constituents of Concern].10,11,19,20  There are methods \nto remove the arsenic, including extraction with water, methanol, or water/methanol mixtures accompanied with sonication or \nmechanical agitation.21  Extraction with microwave -assisted heating and accelerated solvent ex traction systems are described \nin the literature.21  Soaking the algae in water at room temperature followed by simmering in the water is shown to be \neffective for removing inorganic arsenic.22 Another variation entails repeated boiling in seawater, and replacing the water \nthree times, after initial soaking.19  Soaking the algae in a simmering 4% acetic acid or a 4% sodium hydrogen carbonate \naqueous solution has also been shown to remove arsenic.23    \nFigure 1. Overview of methods of manufacture for b rown algae -derived ingredients . 1,9,24 -33,33-57 , CIR STAFF \n \nComposition  \nSome  constituents and constituent groups  that are found  in brown algae , in general , are presented in Table 8; \nincluded therein are alkaloids, laminarins, pheromones,  phytohormones, terpenoids,  amino acids, betaines, and characteristic \npigments such as chlorophyll  a and c, β-carotene, fucoxanthin, and several other xanthophyl ls.58  Constituents found in \nAscophyllum nodosum , Fucus vesiculosus , and Laminaria digitata are listed in Table 9. \nAccording to a study, S argassacean brown algae species biosynthesize mainly meroditerpenes and linear diterpenes, \nwhereas most compounds from the Dictyotacean species are cyclic diterpenoids, sesquiterpenes, and various types of \nmeroterpenes.59  Algae of the family Sargassaceae a re among the most prolific in terms of terpene yield.  In the genera \nCystoseira, Sargassum , and Halidrys,  meroditerpenoids constitute the most common metabolites.  In the genus Cystoseira , \nmeroditerpinoids could be classified into specific groups dependent  upon the structure of their diterpene side chain: linear, \nmonocyclic, bicyclic, or rearranged.  The organic extracts of Cystoseira amentacea  var. stricta contain high amounts of \nmethoxybifurcarenone.   \nSterols are also found in brown algae.60,61  Sterols reported to be in Cystoseira tamariscifolia , Fucus  spiralis , and \nSargassum vulgare  are listed  in Table 10. \nMethanol, hexane, and chloroform extracts from Cystoseira compressa  were examined for flavonoid and phenolic \ncontent.62  The flavonoid content of the methanol, hexane, and chloroform e xtract, were 0 .291 ± 0.02, 0.88 ± 0.07,  and 0.804 \n± 0.07 mg/g, respectively. The phenolic content of hexane (1.541 ± 0.09 mg/g) was considerably higher than the phenolic \ncontent of the methanol (0.161 ± 0.08 mg/g) and chloroform (0.45 ± 0.04 mg/g) extracts.

The \nconstituent with the highest concentration in both extracts is vaccenic acid (21,690 and 2848 ppm, respectively ).63 \nApproximately 0.64 –  1.99 grams of polyphen ols can be found in Himanthalia elongata  extract.64  In addition, \nphlorotannins can also be found in this extract (0.2 % dry weight).  These include fucols, diphloroethol, and several \nfucophloroethols.  Polyphenols are also found in Undaria pinnatifida extract in amounts of 0.08 –  0.60 g/ 100 g extract.   \nFucoidans extracted from the sporophylls of Undaria pinnatifida show a higher sulfate and l -fucose content than ot her \nfucoidans.   The concentration of polyphenols in an aqueous  extract of Halidrys siliquosa  was report ed to be 0.16 %.65  The \ntotal protein and mineral content present in Halidrys siliquosa  is approximat ely 9.6 and 11.19%, respectively.  \nThe composition of a water/propylene glycol extract of Laminaria japonica is provided in  Table 12.56  The \ncompositions of extracts of  Laminaria japonica57 that are produced via enzyme hydrolysis are presented in  Table 13.  \nThe specifications for an alcohol extract of Ecklonia cava, as a food/dietary supplement , include a combined \nphlorotannin content of 90.0 ± 5.0% ; the content of dieckol , a specific phlorotan nin, is 6.6% to 9.9% ( Table 14).9  The extract \nis to contain no insoluble substances , and it is  reported to contain calcium (4800 ± 400 mg/kg), magnesium (1300 mg/kg), \npotassium (700 ± 200 mg/kg ), and iodine (220 ± 40 mg/kg).  \nAn Undaria pinnatifida  extract rich in fucoidan was characterized as having 27% uronic acid, 53% \nmonosaccharides, and 7.4% su lfate.66  Major monosaccharides included 54% fucose and 35% galactose.  The minor \nmonosaccharides were 3% rhamnose, 4% arabinose, and 1% xylose, glucose, and mannose.    \nA desalinated Undaria pinnatifida  powder was reported to consist of 532 mg/g dietary fiber, mostly in the form of \nalginates, and 209 mg/g protein.67  The composition profile is pre sented in  Table 15. \nA study was performed to determine the flavonoid co ntent of four species of  brown  algae.68  Results of this study are \npresented in Table 16.  \nImpurities /Constituents  of Concern  \nPossible fragrance allergens listed in Annex III of EU Cosmetic  Regulation (EC) No. 1223/2009 that were analyzed  \nin trade name mixtures containing relevant brown algae -derived ingredients can be found in Table 17.  \nArsenic, Iodine, and Heavy Metals  \nArsenic, u sually in the form of arsenosugars , is a natural constituent of some brown algae, including Ecklonia \nradiate , Laminaria japonica, and  Sargassum fusiforme .10,11,20,57,69  The amount of arsenic is incon sistent due to varied uptake \nof inorganic arsenic by brown algae varieties and the influence of external factors (e.g., temperature, season , and pH).  A \ntrade name mixtu re containing 4.7% Ascophyllum Nodosum Extract  in 94.5% water was reported to have ≤  2 ppm arsenic.70  \nThe amounts of arsenic that have been measured in 9  brown algae are presented in  Table 18.  The different arsenic -containing \ncompounds  found in four brown algae species are presented in  Table 19.  A comparison of the amount of arsenic found in \nLaminaria japonica and a Laminaria japonica extract (equivalence to cosmetic ingredients  not confirmed)  is presented in  \nTable 20.  \nBrown algae , in general,  exhibit an  affinity for heavy metals , which  are believed to be absorbed from the water \ncolumn.58,71  Heavy metal concentrations in  algae are strongly dependent on environmental parameters of th e sampling sites \n(e.g., salinity, temperature, pH, light, nutrient concentrations, oxygen, etc .) and the  structural differences am ong the algae.  \nThese seaweed s also absorb heavy metals from the sediment.72,73  A trade name mixtu re containing 4.7% Ascophyllum \nNodosum Extract  in 94.5% water was reported to have ≤  20 ppm heavy metals.70 An overview of  the amount of heavy metals \nfound in brown algae species is provided in Table 21.  Information regarding heavy metal impurities in trade name mixtures \ncontaining brown algae can be found in Table 22. \nAn edible , phlorotannin -rich, ethanol extract of Ecklonia cava  has specifications issued by the European Food \nSafety Authority (EFSA) .9  According to the Commission, this extract must contain <  3 mg/kg lead, < 0.1 mg/kg mercury , < \n3 mg/kg cadmium , < 25 mg/kg arsenic, and 150 - 650 mg/kg iodine.  \nPhthalates  \nDibutyl phthalate (DBP)  and di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP)  were shown to occur naturally in Laminaria \njaponica .74  These phthalates were also present in Undaria pinnatifida.  \nUSE  \nCosmetic  \nThe safety of the cosmetic ingr edients included in this assessment is evaluated based on data received from the US \nFood and Drug Administration (FDA)  and the cosmetic industry on the expected use of these ingredients in cosmetics.  Use \nfrequencies of individual ingredients in cosmetics are collected from manufacturers and reported by cosmetic product category in  the FDA  Voluntary Cosmetic Registration Program (VCRP) database.  Use concentration data are submitted by  \nthe cosmetic i ndustry in response to surveys  conducted by the Personal Care Products Council (Council), of maximum reported use concentration by product category.  \nAccording to VCRP data  received in  2019,  Laminaria Digitata Extract is reported to be used in 310 formulations \n(229 in leave -on formulations, 74 in rinse -off formulations, and 7  diluted for the bath; Table 23).75  Fucus Vesiculosus  \nExtract is reported to be used in 291 formulations , Macrocysti s Pyrifera (Kelp) Extract in 199  formulations , and \nAscophyllum Nodosum Extract  is used in 140 formulations .  Laminaria Saccharina Extract is reported to be used in 136 \nformulations.  All other in- use ingredients are reported to be used in  100 formulations or fewer .  \nAscophyllum Nodosum Extract  was reported in the VCRP as Ascophyllum Nodosum (Seaweed) Extract a nd Fucus \nVesiculosus Extract was reported as Fucus Vesiculosus (Bladderwrack) Extract.  Laminaria Saccharina Extract is reported in \nthe VCRP as Saccharina Latissima (Kelp) Extract; the accepted scientific name for Laminaria saccharina is Saccharina \nlatissima .   \nThe results of the concentration of use surveys  conducted by the Council  in 2015 and 2016 indicate  Laminaria \nDigitata Powder  has the highest reported maximum concentration of use; it is used at up to  40% in face and neck \nformulations.76,77  Macrocystis Pyrifera (Kelp) Extract is reported to be used at up to 36.4% in eye lotions.  The other  \ningredients are reported to be used at 6% or less.  \nIn some cases , reports of uses were received in the VCRP, but concentration of use data were  not provided.  For \nexample, Ascophyllum Nodosum Powder is reported to be used in 4  cosmetic formulations, but no use concentration data \nwere reported.  In other cases, no uses were reported in the VCRP, but concentration of use data were reported in the  industry  \nsurvey ; Fucus Vesiculosus had no reported uses in the VCRP, but a use conce ntration in  shampoos, moisturizing \nformulations , and suntan formulations was  provided in the industry survey.  Therefore, it should be presumed there is at least \none use in every category for which  a concentration is reported.   The ingredients not in use a ccording to 2019  VCRP data and \nthe 2015 and 2016 Council  surveys  are listed in  Table 24. \nSeveral of these ingredients are used in formulations that are used near the ey e (e.g., Macrocystis Pyrifera (Kelp) \nExtract at up to 36.4% in eye lotion  and Fucus Vesiculosus  Extract in mascara at up to 5 %), incidentally ingested (e.g., \nMacrocystis Pyrifera (Kelp) Extract in lipsticks at up to 0.079%) , and in formulations that come i n contact with mucous \nmembranes (e.g., Fucus Vesiculosus Extract  and Laminaria Digitata Extract  at up to 5% in bubble baths and Laminaria \nJaponica Extract and Macrocystis Pyrifera (Kelp) Extract at up to 5% in bath oils, tablets and salts).  \nAdditionally,  some of the  brown algae -derived ingredients are used in cosmetic sprays and could possibly be \ninhaled; for example, Macrocystis Pyrifera (Kelp) Extract is reported to be used at up to 0.79% in spray face and neck \nproducts .  In practice, 95% to 99% of the droplets/particles released from cosmetic sprays have aerodynamic equivalent \ndiameters >  10 µm, with propellant sprays yielding a greater fraction of droplets/particles <  10 µm compared with pump \nsprays.78,79  Theref ore, most droplets/particles incidentally inhaled from cosmetic sprays would be deposited in the \nnasopharyngeal and thoracic regions of the respiratory tract and would not be respirable (i.e., they would not enter the lung s) \nto any appreciable amount.80,81  Laminaria Japonica Extract and Macrocystis Pyrifera (Kelp) Extract were reported to be used \nin face powders at concent rations up to 0.0035%.  Conservative estimates of inhalation exposures to respirable particles \nduring the use of loose -powder cosmetic products are 400-  to 1000- fold less than protective regulatory and guidance limits \nfor inert airborne respirable particle s in the workplace.82-84 \nNone  of the brown algae -derived ingredients named in this  report are restricted from use in any way under the rules \ngoverning cosmetic products in the European Union.85  \nNon-Cosmetic  \nBrown seaweeds are consumed around the world and come mostly, but not exclusively from the Laminaria, \nUndaria, and Hizikia  genus .16  According to the US FDA, b rown algae  (i.e., several species of seaweeds that are harvested \nprincipally in coastal waters of the northern Atlantic and Pacific oceans ) are direct food substances that are GRAS  for human \nconsumption for use as flavor enhancers and flavor adjuvants, when the maximum level in food does not exceed  the current \ngood manufacturing practice ( cGMP). [ 21CFR184.1120]  “Kelp” (the d ehydrated, ground product prepared from Macrocystis \npyrifera, Laminaria digitata, Laminaria saccharina, and Laminaria cloustoni ) is approved as a food additive for direct \nadditio n to food for human consumption as a source of iodine or as a dietary supplement . [21CFR172.365]   An overview of \nthe species of brown algae that are GRAS in the US can be seen in Table 25. In New Zealand, Japan and other Asian \ncountries, dried sea kelp is a common food; the exact species of kelp used varies according to location.16 The EFSA NDA \nPanel concluded that an alcohol extract of Ecklonia cava  is safe for the use in food supplements at a maximum intake level of \n163 mg/day for adolescents from 12 to 14 years of age, 230 mg/day for adolescents above 14 years of age, and 263 mg/day \nfor adults.9  In addition, a listing of brown algae species that are frequently ingested by humans is provided in Table 26.  \nSeveral genuses of edible brown algae include Alaria, Himanthalia, Laminaria, Saccharina, Undaria, Ascophyllum, Fucus, \nSargassum, Hizikia, Dictyotales,  and Eisenia . 86 \nIn France, some varieties of seaweed have been authorized for use as vegetables and condiments.87  These include \nAscophyllum nodosum, Fucus vesiculosus, Fucus serratus, Himanthalia elongata, Undaria pinnatifida, Laminaria digitata, \nLaminaria saccharina, Laminaria japonica, and Alaria esculenta .  These algae, when used in this manner, must  not exceed \ncertain levels of toxic minerals ( ≤ 3 mg/kg arsenic, ≤  0.5 mg/kg cadmium, ≤  0.1 mg/kg mercury, ≤ 5 mg/kg lead, ≤  5 mg/kg \ntin, and ≤  2000 mg/kg iodine .  Cystoseira baccata, Cystoseira compressa, and Cystoseira tamariscifolia  are edible brown \nalgae species found in  Portugal.88 In animal drugs, feeds, and related products , brown algae (kelp; Laminaria spp. and Nereocystis  spp.) are GRAS as \nnatural substances [21CFR582.30] and as solvent -free natural extractives [21CFR582.40] used in conjunction with spices and \nother natural seasonings and flavorings.  \nIn the US, “kelp ” is present in  OTC dietary supplements  for weight loss . [21CFR310.545]   However, there are \ninadequate data to establish a general recognition of the s afety and effectiveness of this ingredient  for that specified use.   \nSeveral other sources refer to the use of Fucus vesiculosus  for weight loss .89,90 \nPastes of seaweed, made by cold grinding or freeze crushing, are used in thalassotherapy, in which the pastes  are \napplied to the body and then warmed under infrared radiation.16  This treatment, in conjunction with seawater hydrotherapy, \nis said to provide relief for rheumatism and osteoporosis.   In folk medicine, preparations of Fucus vesiculos us are used to \ntreat hypothyroidism, iodine deficiency, arteriosclerosis, digestive disorders , menstrual abnormalities, cellulite , and \nsprains .89,91  In herbal folk  medicin e, Laminaria hyperborea is used for thyroid regulation , and Macrocystis Pyrifera  is used \nto treat thyroid conditions, anemia in pregnancy, and hypertension , for bringing about weight loss , and as an immunity \nbooster.89 \nBrown algae have been used as fertilizers and soil conditioners ( Ascophyllum , Sargassum , Ecklonia , and Fucus  \nspecies ), animal feed for sheep, cattle,  horses , pigs, and chickens  (Alaria esculenta , and Ascophyllum  and Laminaria species) , \nfeed and feed binder for fish and abalone ( Macrocystis pyrifera ), and biomass fuel ( Macrocystis pyrifera ), and t hey have \nbeen used for waste water/effluent treatment and removal of heavy metals ( Sargassum , Laminaria,  and Ecklonia  species ).16,58  \nBrown algae are used as biomonitors for heavy metal po llution in estuarine  and coastal waters worldwide , and to evaluate the \nquality of  their surrounding environment .71   \nTOXICOKINETIC  STUDIES  \nObtaining data on the toxicokinetics of uncharacterized , complex mixtures would be impractical, as is the case wi th \nmany botanical ingredients.   No toxicokinetics studies were discovered in the published literature, and no unpublished data \nwere submitted.  \nTOXICOLOGICAL STUDIES  \nAcute  Toxicity  Studies  \nNo acute dermal or inhala tion toxicity studies were discovered in the published literature, and no unpublished data \nwere submitted.   Acute oral toxicity studies summarized below are presented in Table 27. \nOral  \nNo mortality was observed when 5 Sprague Dawley rats/sex were given 2000 mg/kg/bw of a test substance \nconsisting of hydroglycolic solution with 3% Agarum Cribosum Extract (m ethod of oral administration was not stated).92  \nThe LD 50 was > 2000 mg/kg when Sprague -Dawley rats were dosed with Ascophyllum Nodosum Extract. No other details \nregarding this study were provided.93  Cystoseira  Compressa Extract was not toxic to mice when given a single dose of up to \n2000 mg/kg by gavage.62  No animals died when Sprague Dawley rats (10/sex)  were given 2000 mg/kg Ecklonia Cava \nExtract (alcohol extract)  by gavage.9  Similarly, no abnormalities were seen when Ecklonia Cava Extract (en zyme extract; \n3000 mg) was given to SD rats (5/sex) or Beagle dogs (2/sex) by oral gavage.94  The oral LD 50s of two Fucus Vesiculosus \nExtracts were 1000 and 500 mg/kg for male  mice  and between 1000 and 20 00 mg/kg and < 750 mg/kg for female  mice .95  In \nrats (sex not stated) , the oral LD 50s of two Fucus Vesiculosus Extracts were between  1000 and 2000 mg/kg  for one  extract  \nand > 2000 mg/kg for  the second extract .95  The oral LD 50 of rats given 20% of a test substance containing Laminaria Digitata \nExtract (≤ 10%), artemisia vulgaris e xtract (≤ 10%), and phenoxyethanol (0.8% ), in water, was >  5 000 mg/kg.96  Sargassum \nFulvellum Extract and Sargassum Thunbergii Extract were n ot toxic to mice that were given a s ingle dose of 5000 mg in 10 \nmL Tween -80 via gavage .55 \nShort -Term , Subchronic, and Chronic  Toxicity  Studies  \nNo repeated dose dermal or inhalation toxicity studies were discovered in the published literature, and no \nunpublished data were  submitted.   Short -term, subchronic, and chronic  oral toxicity studies summarized below are presented \nin Table 28. \nOral  \nAscophyllum Nodosum was not toxic when it was fed to pigs  at up to 10% via feed for 23 days,  or to rats at up to  \n15% in the diet for 4 weeks .50,97 Vomiting was the only adverse effect when Ecklonia Cava Extract in capsules was orally \nadministered (in increasing amounts up to 1000 mg/kg over 8 days) to dogs.9  Ecklonia Cava Extr act was not toxic to rats \ndosed with up to 3000 mg/kg vi a oral gavage once daily in rats, and twice daily in dogs , for 13 weeks .9,94  An enzyme extract \nof Ecklonia Cava Extract  (starting at doses of  2000 mg/kg) administered by gavage for 2 weeks  caused reduced ovary and \nbrain weights  in female rats.94  Hepatic effects in rats were observed when animals were dosed with 2000 mg/kg/day via \ngavage of  an alcohol Ecklonia Cava Extract  for 4 week s.9   While consuming high -fat diets, there were no adverse effects \ncaused by alcohol Ecklonia Cava Extract when mice were given doses of up to 5 mg/ kg/day via gavage for 4 weeks.98  When \nrats were dosed with the same extract at doses of 1500 mg/kg/day  for 13 weeks , there were also decreases in body weight \ngain and organ weights  (the hepatic effects resolved after 4 weeks recovery) .9  Increased  liver weights were apparent when t wo ethanol Fucus Vesiculosus Extracts  (starting at doses of 200 \nmg/kg/day) were administered by gavage for 4 weeks in male  rats.95  No treatment -related effects were noted in females.  An  \nethano l Laminaria  Japonica Extract (up to 400 mg/kg) administered by gavage for 6 weeks caused decreased body weight \ngain, fat -pad weights, and serum  and hepatic lipid levels in rats .51   \nIn rats, doses of 1200 to 4000 mg/kg Cladosiphon  Okamuranus Extract given once a day for 3  months via gavage \ncaused a dose- dependent increase in clotting time and decrease in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) that was not observed with \nlower doses.52  There were no other adverse effects reported.  \nLaminaria  Japonica Powder  (up to 5%)  was incorporated in the feed of mice from the age of 7 weeks until death.  \nThere were no dose- depende nt effects on the lifespan of mice.53 Undaria  Pinnatifida Extract administered via  drinking water \n(1.5 g in 1000 mL water) did  not cause any toxic effects in rats when administered for 32 weeks.99  Undaria Pinnatifida \nPowder (0.1, 1, or 5%) was given to 5 female SD rats for 36 weeks via diet.100  No adverse effects were reported.  \nDEVELOPMENTAL AND REPRODUCTIVE  TOXICITY  (DART)  STUDIES  \nNo DART studies were discovered in the published literature, and no unpublished data were  submitted.  \nGENOTOXICITY STUDIES  \nThe in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies summarized below are detailed  in Table 29. \nIn Vitro  \nAscophyllum Nodosum Extract was not genotoxic in two  Ames assay s (up to 5000 µg/plate) , a mammalian cel l \ngene mutation test (up to 500  µg/mL ), or in chromosom al aberration assays (up to 5 mg/mL ; human lymphocytes ); in a \nmammalian cel l gene mutation test, Ascophyllum Nodosum Extract was genotoxic to Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO)  cells \nstarting at 1500 µ g/mL .6,93  An Ames test was performed according to the Organisation for  Economic Co -operation and \nDevelopment  (OECD ) test guideline (TG)  471 on a trade name mixture containing 4.7% Ascophyllum Nodosum Extract in \n94.5% water.70  No mutagenic acti vity was reported .  Cystoseira Compressa Extract was not mutagenic in an Ames assay \nperformed with and without metabolic activation at up to 5 mg/plate.62  An Ames test was performed with and without \nmetabolic activation using a trade name mixture consisting of 1  - 3% Cystoseira Compressa Extract  in amilopectin gly cerine \nwater  (up to 51.95 mg/plate; S almonella  typhimurium ).101  Ecklonia Cava Extract was not genotoxic in Ames assays (up to \n5000 µg/plate) or chromosom al aberration assays (up to 350 µ g/plate).9,94   Halidrys Siliquosa Extract was non -mutagenic in \nan Ames a ssay, performed according to OE CD TG 471, at up to 5 µL/plate.65  Another Ames assay performed according to \nOECD TG 471 resulted in negative results when testing the genotoxic potential of a mixture consisting of Fucus Spiralis \nExtract (12%), tetraselmis chui extract (8%), and water (80%) ( up to 5 µL/plate).  102 Aqueous Fucus Vesiculosus Extract was \nnot genotoxic in a chromosom al aberration assay (up to 1 mg/mL ; human peripheral lymphocytes ) or a comet assay (up to 1 \nmg/mL ; human peripheral lymphocytes ).103  Laminaria digitata was non -mutagenic in an assay performed with and without \nmetabolic activation (concentrations not stated).104  A trade name m ixture containing Laminaria Saccharina Extract in sea \nwater and methylpropandiol was non- mutagenic in an Ames assay (up to 5000 µ g/plate).105  Macrocystis Pyrifera (Kelp) \nExtract was non -mutagenic in an Ames assay (1 mL test substance in 10 mL 0.9% sodium chloride; concentration of extract \nwas approximately 4% ).106  A trade name mixture containing 24% Und aria Pinnatifida Cell Culture Extract was not \nmutagenic in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (up to 5000 µg/plate).107 No genotoxicity was reported in a chemiluminescent \n3D assay using water (52%) and Cystoseira Amentacea/  Caespitosa/Brachycarpa Extract (48%) as the test substance at up to \n10%.108  The test system for this study was not reported.  \nIn Vivo  \nEcklonia Cava Extract was not genotoxic in micronucleus assays up to 3000 mg/kg  using male CD1 mice .  Test \nsubstances were administered via gavage.9,94   \nCARCINOGENICITY STUDIES  \nNo carcinogenicity studies were disco vered in the published literature, and no unpublished data were  submitted.   \nTumor Promotion  \nTumor promotion studies summarized below are detailed  in Table 30.  The brown algae -derived ingredients that \nwere tested were not tumor promoters ; instead,  decreases  in the number, incidence, and size of tumors in rats and mice  were \nobserved .   \nDermal  \nMice were  treated dermally with a single dose of 7,12- dimethylbenz [a]anthracene (DMBA; a carcinogen)  followed \nby biweekly treatments  for fifteen weeks  with 12 -O-tetradecanoylphorbol -13-acetate (TPA; a tumor promotor)  or Undaria \nPinnatifida Extract (1 mg) .109  The mice treated with Undaria Pin natifida Extract  had a delayed appearance of skin tumors (14 \nvs 8 weeks) and fewer tumors (average 0.2 vs 3.7) compared to the TPA -treated mice . \nOral  \nRats injected with azoxymethane  (AOM; a carcinogen) and then fed a diet containing Hizikia Fusiforme Extract  (2% and 6%) had a reduced number of colorectal tumors  (21 vs 58)  compared to rats injected w ith AOM  and fed a normal \ndiet.110  A Saccharina angustata  powder (5%; inference for Saccharina Angustata Extract) in feed delayed the app earance \nand reduced the incidences of mammary tumors in rats orally administered DMBA .111   \nRats administered  N-methyl -N′-nitro -N-nitrosoguanidine  (MNNG; a carcinogen)  followed by  Sargassum Pallidum \nExtract ( 0, 400, 600 and 800 mg/kg/day ) in drinking water  for 8 weeks  had decreased  inflammatory  responses; serum IL -6, \nIL-1β, and TNF -α levels and concentration of serum and gastric mucosa malondialdehyde  (MDA; an oxidant) were decreased \nin a dose -dependent manner .112  In rats administered Undaria Pinnatifida Powder (0, 1.0% or 5.0% in feed) for 8 weeks after \noral administration of DMBA, the mean combined weight of all mammary tumors of each rat in treatment groups was lower \nthan that in the control group ( approximately  7 vs 20 g).100  Undaria Pinnatifida Extract (100% as drinking water) for 32 \nweeks reduced the incidence of mammary tumors (22% vs 100%) after  female rats  were  orally administered DMBA.99  \nOTHER RELEVANT STUDIES  \nEndocrine Effects  \nIn Vitro  \nFucus vesiculosus  extract   \nHuman granulosa cells (obtained from 8 women) were treated with a water:ethanol (1:1) Fucus vesiculosus  extract \n(25, 50, or 75 µmol/l) for 9 days.113  Ethanol (50%) served as the vehicle control.  A t 50 and 75 µmol/l , the extract \nsignificantly reduced 17 -β-estradiol levels in human granulosa cells and also competed with estradiol  (E2) and progesterone \nfor binding to their  receptors.  \nAffinity of 1 or more components of a  water:ethanol (1:1) Fucus vesiculosus  extract  for estrogen receptor -α (ERα), \nERβ, and progesterone receptor  (PR)-B was determined by radiometric competitive binding assays.113  Dried extract (0.5, 5, \nor 50 µ mol/l final concentration) was  re-solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide and  combined with ER α or ER β and 0.5 nmol/ l \nestradio l.  Non-specific binding was  estimated in the presence of 1 µ mol/l diethylstilbesterol.   To test  this receptor  binding, \nthe e xtract was incubated  with PR -B and 1.4 nmol/l radiolabeled progesterone .  Non-specific binding was  estimated in the \npresence of 1 µ mol/l progesterone.   The e xtract  compete d for and bou nd to ER α (IC 50 = 42.2 µ mol/l) , ERβ (IC 50 = 31.8 \nµmol/l) , and PR -B (IC 50 = 31.8 µ mol/l) , with a  slightly  greater  affinity for ER β.  The  inhibition of progesterone production \nwas less prominent , and there was no concentration -response relationship.  In contrast, there was a concentrat ion-dependent \noccupancy of the estrogen and progesterone receptors.   Compounds found  in Fucus vesiculosus could act as estradiol \nantagonists  via ligand competion for  ERα or ERβ . \nIn competitive radio -ligand binding assays, aromatase activity was estimated by measuring the incorporation of  \ntritium from androstenedione into water  in the presence or absence of a Fucus vesiculosus  extract (10, 50, or  100 µmol/L).113  \nAromatase activity following treatment of  human luteinized granulosa cells  (hLGCs ) with this extract did not change.  \nA chemically activated luciferase reporter  (CALUX®) assay was used to determine the effect of an aqueous  Fucus \nvesiculosus  extract on activation  of the ER.114  Aromatase enzymatic activit y was measured to determine the potential effect \nof this extract on E2 biosynthesis.   In co -treatments with  E2, this e xtract (2%)  reduced the activation of the luciferase reporter \nby up to 50% , exhibiting ER  antagonistic effects.   The effect  of this e xtract (0 to 2%) on aromatase activity was measured \nusing recombinant human CYP19  enzymatic hydrolysis of the fluorescent substrate, 7 -methoxy -4-trifluoromethyl coumarin, \nin a 96 -well plate.   Ketoconazole was used as the positive marker of aromatase inhibi tion.  This e xtract  inhibited aromatase \nactivity (IC 50 2.0%).   ER-dependent and - independent  cancer cell lines showed significantly decreased viability  with \nincreasing Fucus vesiculosus  extract concentrations ; altered  morphological features suggest ed apopt osis and autophagy.   The \ncell line -specific sensitivity suggests that Fucus vesiculosus  extract was not toxic at up to 2% , but instead induces cell death \nthrough modulated pathways.   \nAnimal  \nFucus vesiculosus  powder   \nFemale Sprague -Dawley rats (n = 8), that  had two confirmed normal estrous cycles, were administered a Fucus \nvesiculosus  powder (0, 175, or 350 mg/kg/day) on an apple wedge daily for 4 weeks.113  Vaginal smears were obtained and \ndaily logs were maintained to monitor estrous cycling.  No adverse effects were observed during the course of the \nexperiment.  Administration of this p owder resulted in a statistically -significant, dose-dependent increase in the length of the \nestrous cycle in the treated rats.  In the control group, the mean number of days of the estrous cycle was 4.3 ± 0.96 days \ncompared to 5.4 ± 1.7 days in the low -dose group and 5.9 ± 1.9 days in the high- dose group.  Treatment with this p owder \ncaused an overall 100% increase in the mean length of the diestrus phase of the estrous cycle.  Th e mean number of days in \ndiestrus was 0.97 ± 0.22 among the controls compared to 1.4 ± 0.54 in the low -dose group and 2.1 ± 0.88 days in the high -\ndose group.  Treatment had no significant effect on the number of days in estrus, proestrus, or metestrus duri ng the mean \nestrous cycle.  After treatment was stopped, five rats stopped normal estrous cycling; one remained in estrus and four in \ndiestrus.  \nBlood sample s were collected  from female Sprague -Dawley rats (n = 19 ) before treatment  with dried Fucus \nvesiculo sus powder , and at 2 and 4 weeks of the oral administration of this p owder (0 or 175 mg/kg/d) on apple wedges.113   \nAt 2 weeks, mean serum 17β -estradiol levels were reduced from 48.9 ± 4.5 to 40.2 ± 3.2 ng/l and, after 4 weeks, reduced the levels  from baseline to 36.7 ± 2.2 ng/l  (25% decrease) , suggesting an effect of dosing over time.  Serum progesterone levels \nbetween controls and the treatment groups did not differ.  \nBlood sample s were collected  from female Sprague -Dawley rats (n = 8), that had  naturally  high circulating estradiol \nlevels (≥ 50 µg/l), before, and after 1 week of the oral administration of Fucus vesiculosus  powder (350 mg/kg/day) on apple \nwedges.113  Median serum 17 -β-estradiol levels decreased by 38%.  The range in reduction of serum 17- β-estradiol levels in 6 \nof the rats was 25% to 58%, whereas 2 rats had levels similar to their baseline levels.  Progesterone levels were not \nsignificantly affected following this treatment.   This could be due to the fact that in the studies with rats t he blood sample s \nwere collected  in the morning,  and in the morning the 17 -β-estradiol levels were at their peak but the progesterone levels \nwere not.  \nPhotoprotection  \nSargassum muticum  \nThe effect of the ethyl acetate fraction of Sargassum muticum  extract against cell death induced by mid-wavelength \nultraviolet ( UVB ) radiation was studied.115  Cells were seeded in a 96 -well plate at a concentration of  1x10-5 cells/mL. \nSixteen hours after plating, 100 µ g/mL of Sargassum muticum  extract were added to the cells and exposed to UVB radiation \nat a dose of 150 mJ/ cm2.  Cell viability was 61%  in UVB (150 mJ/ cm2) irradiated  cells and 70% in UVB -irradiated cells \ntreated with Sargassum muticum  extract. Decreased numbers of apoptotic bodies as well as DNA fragmentation was apparent \nin cells co -exposed to Sargassum muticum  extract and UVB , versus UVB exposure alone.   \nDERMAL IRRITATION AND SENSI TIZATION  STUDIES  \nThe dermal irritation and sensitization studies summarize d below are presented in Table 31. \nIrritation  \nIn Vitro  \nIn vitro dermal irritation assays were performed on a mixture containing 24% Undaria Pinnatifida Cell Culture \nExtract in water; a mixture containing Laminaria Japonica (7%),  Nereocystis Leutkeana (7%),   Macrocystis Pyrifera Extract \n(7%),  and pentaerythrityl t etraethylhexanoate ; and a mixture containing Sargassum Filipendula Extract (1.3%), water \n(81.78%), sorbitol (14%), hypnea musciformis extract (1.4%), gellidiela acerosa extract (1.3%), m ethylparaben (0.2%), and \npropylparaben (0.2%) .116,117,118   These trade name mixtures were considered to be non -irritating.  \nAnimal  \nAscophyllum Nodosum Extract (4.7%; aqueous), Laminaria Digitata Extract (0.5 %)  with dipropylene glycol and \nwater or water and sea salt, and Laminaria Digitata Extract (0.5 %) with artemisia vulgaris extract, phenoxyethanol , and \nwater , were non -irritating in ani mal dermal irritation studie s.6,54,96,93 \nHuman  \nMany human irritation studies were provided using test substances containing a brown algae ingredient, or \ncombination of ingredients, along with other substances such as caprylic/capric triglycerides, butylene glycol, water, sea salt, \npropylene glycol, phenoxyethanol, panthenol, or dipropylene glycol. The majority of these studies resulted in ne gative \nresults; however, irritation was seen in several studies after treatment with high concentrations or short periods of exposur e.  \nIn a study using a trade name mixture consisting of Fucus Spiralis Extract (< 5%) in caprylic/capric triglycerides as th e test \nsubstance, slight irritation was observed after 30 minutes, however, no irritation was reported after 24 hours.119  A trade name \nmixture containing 20% Himanthalia Elongata Extract, 37% Undaria Pinnatifida Extract, and 43% water, was considered to be very slightly irritating to human skin.\n64   When a test substance consisting of Laminaria Digitata Extract (1.5  - 2.5%) in \nwater and propylene glycol was applied to the skin, moderate irritation was observed after 30 minutes, and slight irritation \nwas observed after 24  hours.120  In a different study, Laminaria Saccharina Extract (1 -  3%) in water and propylene glycol \nwas applied at concentrations of 8, 16, and 100% to 10 subjects.121  Slight irritation was observed at the 100% dose level, and \nno irritation was observed at the lower doses.  When a trade name mixture containing Pelvetia Canaliculata Extract (1 -  3%) \nin propylene glycol and water was applied to the skin, moderate irritation was noted after 30 minutes, and slight irritation was \nnoted after 24 hours.122   Similar results were observed when a trade name mixture consisting of Undaria Pinnatifida Extract \n(< 5%) in water and propylene glyc ol was applied to the skin of 12 subjects.123  In a different study, the test substance (trade \nname mixture contai ning Pelvetia Canaliculata Extract and Laminaria Digitata Extract extracted in propylene glycol with \npanthenol (the amount of dry extract of both extracts combined is estimated to be 5.5 - 9.0%) ) was applied to the skin of 10 \nsubjects at concentrations of 5, 10, and 100%.124  Mild irritation was observed at the 100% conc entration, minimal irritation \nwas observed at the 10% concentration, and no irritation was reported at the 5% concentration.  \nSensitization  \nIn Vitro  \nAn ARE -Nfr2 Luciferase Test utilizing human keratinocyte cells at concentrations up to 2000 µM was performed to \nstudy the sensitization potential of Undaria Pinnatifida Cell Culture Extract (24%).125  The test substance was non -sensitizing. \nA direct peptide reactivity assay (DPRA) performed testing the sensitizing potential of the same ingredient yielded negative results.126  An ARE -Nfr2 Luciferase Test was also performed on a trade name mixture contai ning Sargassum Filipendula \nExtract (1.3%), water (81.78%), s orbitol (14%), Hypn ea Musciformis Extract (1.4%), gellidiela acerosa extract (1.3%), \nmethylparaben (0.2%), and p ropylparaben (0.025%) .126  No sensitization potential was observed.  \nAnimal  \nA guinea pig maximization test was performed  according to OECD 406 guidelines  on 18 male an imals  using a test \nsubstance consisting of 3% Agarum Cribrosum Extract in a hydroglycolic solution.92  No sensitization was observed.  \nAscophyllum Nodosum Extract (25% -  75%), was non -sensitizing when applied to the skin of 20 guinea pigs.93  No \nsensitization was noted when a cream containing 0.0023% Cystoseira Amentacea/Caespitosa/B rachycarpa Extract was \napplied to 25 animals in a guinea pig maximization test.127   \nHuman  \nAll in vivo sensitization studies performed on humans, evaluating various  brown algae -derived  ingredients (Alaria \nEsculenta Extract (0.5 -  2.5% and < 5%), Ascophyllum Nodosum Extract (0.5% -  75% ),  Cystoseira Baccata Extract (0.5 –  \n10%), Cystosei ra Compressa Extract (1 -3%), Cystoseira Tamariscifolia Extract (0.5 - 10%), Dictyopteris Polypodioides \nExtract (0.5 – 10%), Fucus Spiralis (1 - 3%), Fucus Vesiculosus Extract (5%),  Halidrys Siliquosa Extract (48%), Halopteris \nScoparia Extract (0.5 – 10%), Himanthalia Elongata Extract (0.2%), Macrocystis Pyrifera (Kelp) Extract (4%),  Laminaria \nDigitata Extract (< 1 2%), Laminaria Ochroleuca Extract (<5%),  Laminaria Saccharina Extract (< 3%), Pelvetia Canaliculata \nExtract (< 44%), Phyllacantha Fibrosa Extract (< 10%), Sphacelaria Scoparia Extract, Sargassum Filipendula Extract (1.2%),  \nSargassum Muticum Extract (0.076%), and Undaria Pinnatifida Extract (<5%)), were negative.54,65,96,106,119,127-132,132-146  \nPhototoxicity  \nIn Vitro  \nAscophyllum Nodosum Extract  \nA phototoxicity study was performed according to OECD TG 432 (3T3 NRU phototoxicity test) using a trade name \nmixture containing 4.7% Ascophyllum Nodosum  Extract in 94.5% water.70  No additional details were provided.  No \nphototoxic activity was reported.   \nOCULAR IRRITATION  STUDIES  \n The studies summarized below are presented in  Table 32. \nIn Vitro  \nNumerous HET -CAM tests were performed; almost all reported no or slight/mild irritation.   Moderate irritation was \nalso noted when a mixture of cosmetic products  (Laminaria Ochroleuca Extract (5%), caprylic/capric triglycerides (94.75%), \nand tocopherols (0.25%) ), was used in a HET -CAM assay.147  Three ocular irritation assays performed using reconstructed \ncornea epithelium yielded negative results.  \nAnimal  \nAscophyllum nodosum  extract (100 mg  of the dried material ) was mildly irritating when applied to the eyes of New \nZealand White rabbits.6  In a different study performed according to OECD TG 405, Ascophyllum Nodosum Extract was \nslightly irritating.148  A test substance (diluted to 22% in water; 0.1 mL) containing Lamina ria Digitata Extract (≤ 10%), \nartemisia vulgaris extract (≤ 10%), phenoxyethanol (0.8%), and water , was non -irritating when placed in the eyes of New \nZealand White rabbits.96 \nHuman  \nThe ophthalmic irritation potential of an eye cream containing 0.076% Sargassum Muticum Extract was tested in 31 \nsubjects, approximately 50% of which wore soft contact lenses.149  The test material did not indicate a potential for \nophthalmologic irritation and was considered safe for use by both contact and non -contact lens wearers.  \nCLINICAL STUDIES  \nCase Reports  \nOral case reports  regarding brown algae -derived  supplements  are presented in  Table 33.   Decreased platelet count \nand an increased amount of arsenic in the blood were  noted in subjects taking kelp supplements.  150,151  \n Clinical Trials  \nDermal  \nA gel formulation containing 1 % of an aqueous extract of Fucus vesiculosus  (0.2 mL) was tested in a double -blind, \nplacebo -controlled experiment.49  Female subjects (n = 10) applied the gel to one cheek at least twice per day (morning and \nevening) for 5 weeks.  T he same gel, without the extract, was applied to the other cheek.  The skin was examined before the \nexperiment began, daily, and after the experiment ended.  There were no signs of erythema or edema during the experiment.  Oral  \nOral clinical trials summariz ed below are presented in Table 34.   \nIn a 2-week oral clinical trial in which  an Ascophyllum nodosum  powder (0.5g/d) was administered to healthy \nfemale subjects , median urinary iodine concentrations  increased from 78 mg/l  to 140 mg/l , and thyroid -stimulating hormone \n(TSH)  concentrations increased slightly , but remained within the normal range .152  There were no adverse events reported.   \nAdministration of a n alcohol extract of Ecklonia cava (400 mg/d)  to subjects  with hypercholesterolaemia fo r 12 weeks  did \nnot have an effect on hematology, clinical chemistry, or  urinalysis parameters ; however, one instance (2.2%) each of nausea, \ndyspepsia, diarrhea, and alopecia were reported .9,153  A phlorotannin -rich extract of Ecklonia cava (0, 72, or 144 mg/d) was \nadministered  for 12 weeks  to overweight patients in a randomized , double -blind study. H ematological and clinical chemistry \ndid not reveal any adverse ef fects; the 144 mg/d group showed decreases in serum glucose and systolic blood pressure  \n(SBP) .9  No adverse effects were reported when Ecklonia Cava Extract  (alcohol extract; 400 mg)  was given to  40 overweight \nsubjcts for 12 weeks.29  Administration of capsules containing a  desalinated Undaria pinnatifida  powder  (average intake \nestimated to be 3.3 g /d) to hypertensive subjects for 8 weeks  resulted in a decrease in the average SBP,  diastolic blood \npressure (DBP), and total cholesterol; adverse effects included two cases of indigesti on and one case of diarrhea, both  of \nwhich resolved quickly without treatment .67  \nThree pre- menopausal women with irregular menstrual cycles were administered a Fucus vesiculosus  powder.154  \nSubject number 1 was 43 years old with hypermenorrhea, polymenorrhea, dysmenorrhea, luteal phase deficiency, and \nendometriosis.  Subject number 2 was 42 years old with hypermenorrhea, polymenorrhea, and dysmenorrhea.  Subject \nnumber 3 was 21 years old with hypermenorrhea, dysmenorrhea, and endo metriosis.  Menstrual cycles were tracked for three \ncycles and serum 17β -estradiol and progesterone levels were measured before treatment started.  Then the women were \nadministered this p owder in capsules (700 mg/d) for two menstrual cycles.  Serum  17-β-estradiol and progesterone levels \nwere measured  again .  Subject 2 stopped treatment at this point and subjects 1 and 3 continued treatment with a great er dose \nof this p owder (1400 mg/day) for two more cycles . This powder  increased the menstrual cycle length and reduced the days of \nmenstruation  in a dose -dependent manner (Table 35). In subject 1, the plasma estradiol levels were d ecreased (before: 626 ± \n91 pg/mL ; low dose: 164 ± 30 pg/m L; high dose: 92.5 ± 3.5 pg/m L) and the progesterone levels were increased (before: 0.58 \n± 0.14 ng/m L; low -dose: 8.4 ± 2.6 ng/m L; high -dose: 16.8 ±0.7 ng/m L).154 \nSUMMARY  \nThis is a review of the safety of 82 brown algae -derived ingredients .  However, several of these ingredients may be \nequivalent according to accepted scientific names ; accordingly, the number of distinct cosmetic ingredients is 74.  The \ningredients in this review are extracts, powders, juices, or waters derived from one or multiple species of brown algae and \nmay be derived from the whole or a defined part of the seaweed.  “Brown algae” is  a common name for seaweeds of the  class \nPhaeophyceae , which ha ve an ab undance of xanthophyll pigments and are a known source of alginate.  The  most  frequent ly \nreported  function  of brown algae ingredients in cosmetics is as a skin -conditio ning agent ; other reported functions include \nabsorbent, antioxidant, binder, hair conditioning agent, oxidizing agent, and viscosity increasing agent.   \nExtraction methods and solvents vary, depending on the desired composition of the final ingredient.  Po wders , \nhowever,  are generally the dried algae pulverized by milling.   Arsenic , usually in the form of arsenosugars,  is a natural \nconstituent of brown algae  and the amount in harvested algae can be reduced by several methods. In addition to arsenic, \nbrown a lgae exhibit an  affinity for heavy  metals  and uptake is strongly dependent on environmental parameters.  \nAccording to VCRP data received in 201 9, Laminaria Digitata Extract is reported to be used in 310 formulations \n(229 in leave -on formulations, 74 in rins e-off formulations, and 7  diluted for the bath; Table 23).75  Fucus Vesiculosus  \nExtract is reported to be used in 291 formulations , Macrocysti s Pyrifera (Kelp) Extract in 199  formulations , and \nAscophyllum Nodosum Extract  is used in 140 formulations .  The results of the concentration of use survey s conducted by the \nCouncil in 2015 and 2016 indicate Laminaria Digitata Powder has the highest reported maximum concentration of use; it is \nused at up to 40% in face and neck formulations .  Macrocystis Pyrifera (Kelp) Extract is reported to be used at up to 36.4% in \neye lotions.  The rest of these ingredients are reported to be used at 6% or less.  \nAccording to the US FDA, brown algae (i.e., several species of seaweeds that are harvested principally in coastal \nwaters of the northern Atlantic and Pacific oceans) are direct food substances that are GRAS for human consumption for use \nas flavor enhancers and flavor adjuvants, when the maximum level in food does not exceed the c GMP). “Kelp” (the \ndehydrated, ground product prepared from Macrocystis pyrifera, Laminaria digitata,  Laminaria saccharina, and Laminaria \ncloustoni) is approved as a food additive for direct addition to food for human consumption as a source of iodine or as a \ndietary supplement.   In animal drugs, feeds, and related products , brown algae (kelp; Laminaria spp. and Nereocystis  spp.) \nare GRAS as n atural substances and as solvent -free natural extractives used in conjunction with spices and other natural \nseasonings and flavorings .  \nAcute oral administration of brown algae extracts was not toxic to mice, rats, an d dogs.  No mortality was observed \nwhen 2000 mg/kg/bw of 3% Agarum Cribosium Extract in hydroglycolic solution was given to Sprague -Dawley rats.  The \nLD 50 was reported to be > 2000 mg/kg when Sprague -Dawley rats were given Ascophyllum Nodosum extract.  Cys toseira  \nCompressa Extract was not toxic to mice up to 2000 mg/kg by gavage.  Ecklonia Cava Extract was not toxic to rats and dogs \nup to 3000 mg/kg by gavage .  The oral LD 50s of two different Fucus Vesiculosus Extracts were 500 mg/kg and great er for mice an d rats.    Sargassum Fulvellum Extract and Sargassum Thunbergii Extract administered by gavage were not toxic to \nmice.  The oral LD 50 of rats given 20% of a test substance containing Laminaria Digitata Extract ( ≤ 10%) , artemisia vulgaris \nextract ( ≤ 10%), and phenoxyethanol (0.8%), in water, was > 5000  mg/kg.  \nIn oral short -term and subchronic studies, there were some adverse effects observed.  In rats, Cladosiphon \nOkamuranus Extract  (1200 to 4000 mg/kg by gavage)  caused a dose- dependent increase in clotting time and decrease in  \nALP ; there were no other adverse effects reported.   An enzyme extract of Ecklonia Cava Extract (starting at 2000 mg/kg) \nadministered by gavage for 2 weeks caused reduced ovary and brain weights in female rats.   Hepatic effects in rats were \nobserved when animals were treated with an  alcohol Ecklonia Cava Extract at 2000 mg/kg/day for 4 week s and at 1500 \nmg/kg/day for 13 weeks (the hepatic effects resolved after 4 weeks of recovery) .  There were increased liver weights in male \nrats treated with t wo ethanol Fucus Vesiculosus Extracts (starting at 200 mg/kg/day)  administered by gavage for 4 weeks. \nVomiting was the onl y adverse effect when Ecklonia Cava Extract capsules (in increasing amounts up to 1000 mg/kg over 8 \ndays)  were orally administered to dogs.  \nIn other oral short -term and subchronic studies, there were no adverse effects observed.  Ascophyllum Nodosum \nwas not toxic to pigs  for 23 days  or to rats for 4 weeks administered in feed at up to 10% and 15%, respectivel y.  While  \nconsuming high- fat diets, there were no adverse effects  caused  by alcohol Ecklonia Cava Extract (up to 5 mg/day) \nadministered to mice by gavage daily for  4 weeks and a n ethanol Laminaria Japonica Extract (up to 400 mg/kg) administered \nby gavage f or 6 weeks caused decreased body weight g ain, fat -pad weights, and serum  and hepatic lipid levels  in rats .  An \nEcklonia cava powder (up to 0.15%; i nference for Ecklonia Cava Extract and Ecklonia Cava Water ) administered in feed for \n28 days was not toxic to weanling pigs.   \nIn a chronic oral toxicity study, t he NOAEL of a Laminaria Japonica Extract administered to rats by gavage for 6 \nmonths was 300 mg/kg/day .  In females, a decrease in AST was observed starting at 300 mg/kg/day and, at 2500 mg/kg/day, \nthere  was decreased serum glucose concentration; all effects returned to baseline a fter a 1-month  recovery.   Laminaria \nJaponica Powder incorporated into feed did not affect the lifespan of mice at up to 5%.  In rats, Undaria Pinnatifida Extract  \nadministered as drinking water at a concentration of 1.5 g/L for 32 weeks and incorporated into the feed (at up to 5%) for 36 \nweeks did not cause any toxic effects.  \nIn genotoxicity assays of several of the brown algae -derived ingredients, all results were negative with th e exception \nof an Ascophyllum Nodosum Extract in one mammalian cel l gene mutation test in which the extract was genotoxic starting at \n1500 µg/mL in CHO cells .  With metabolic activation, Ascophyllum Nodosum Extract was not genotoxic in CHO cells.   \nAscophy llum Nodosum Extract was not genotoxic in two Ames assay s and a mammalian cel l gene mutation test (up to 50 0 \nµg/mL ), and in chromosome aberration assays (up to 5 mg/mL).  Cystoseira Compressa Extract (up to 51.95  mg/plate) was \nnot genotoxic in two Ames  assays.  Ecklonia Cava Extract was not genotoxic in Ames assays (up to 5000 µ g/plate) and \nchromosome aberration assays (up to 350 µ g/plate).  Fucus Spiralis Extract in water and tetraselmis chui extract was non -\ngenotoxic in an Ames assay (up to 5 µ g/plate).  Aqueous Fucus Vesiculosus Extract was not genotoxic in a chromosome \naberration assay and a comet assay (up to 1 mg/mL).  Halidrys Siliquosa Extract was non -mutagenic in an Ames assay (up to \n5 µL/plate).  Laminaria Japonica Extract (up to 5000 µ g/plate) was  not mutagenic in an Ames assay and a chromosome \naberration assay.  Macrocystis Pyrifera (Kelp) Extract was non -mutagenic in an Ames assay (1 mL test substance in 10 mL \n0.9% sodium chloride; concentration of extract not provided).   Undaria Pinnatifida Extr act was not genotoxic in Ames assays \nand chromosome aberration assays (up to 5000 µ g/mL).  I n a micronucleus assay , Ecklonia Cava Extract (up to 3000 mg/kg), \nwas not genotoxic.  An Ames test performed using a trade name mixture containing Laminaria Sacchar ina Extract in sea \nwater and methylpropandiol at up to 5000 µ g/plate resulted in negative results.  A different Ames test was performed \naccording to OECD TG 471 using a trade name mixture containing 4.7% Ascophyllum Nodosum Extract in 94.5% water.   \nNo mut agenic activity was reported. In a bacterial reverse mutation assay performed according to OECD TG 471, a trade \nname mixture containing 24% Undaria Pinnatifida Extract was not mutagenic (up to 5000 µg/plate).  No genotoxicity was \nreported in a chemilumines cent 3D assay using water 52% and Cystoseira Amentacea/Caespitosa/ Brachycarpa Extract \n(48%) as the test substance.  \nNone of the orally or dermally administered brown algae- derived ingredients tested (e.g., Hizikia Fusiforme Extract, \nSaccharina Angustata Ex tract (inference from Saccharina angustata powder), Undaria Pinnatifida Extract , and  Undaria \nPinnatifida Powder ) were tumor (mammary and colorectal)  promoters; instead, decreases in the number, incidence, and/or \nsize of tumors in rats were reported. Rats administered MNNG followed by 8 weeks of  Sargassum Pallidum Extract ( 400 to \n800 mg/kg/day) in drinking water  exhibited decreased  inflammatory responses.   \nA Fucus vesiculosus  extract exhibited estrogen effects in several in vitro studies.  This extrac t (50 and 75 µmol/l ) \nreduced 17 -β-estradiol levels in human granulosa cells and also competed with estradiol and progesterone for binding to the \nrespective receptors.  In another study, a Fucus vesiculosus  extract  competed for, and bound to, ER α (IC 50 = 42.2 µmol/l), \nERβ (IC 50 = 31.8 µ mol/l) , and PR -B (IC 50 = 31.8 µ mol/l) , with a slightly higher affinity for ERβ.  In co -treatments with E2 \n(12.5 pM; EC 50), a Fucus vesiculosus  extract (2%) reduced the activation of the luciferase reporter by up to 50%, exhibiting \nER antagonistic effects.  ER -dependent and -independent cancer cell lines showed significantly decreased viability with \nincreasing test material concentrations .  The cel l line -specific sensitivity suggests that Fucus vesiculosus  extract was not toxic \nat up to 2%, but instead induces cell death through modulated pathways.   In one study, a romatase activity following treatment \nof hLGCs with  a Fucus vesiculosus  extract (10 to  100 µmol/L ) did not change.  In in vivo studies, a Fucus vesiculosus  powder exhibited estrogenic effects.  Oral administration (175 and 350 \nmg/kg/day) for 4 weeks resulted in a dose -dependent increase in the length of the estrous cycle and an overall 100% increase \nin the mean length of the diestrus phase of the estrous cycle in the treated rats.  Mean serum 17 -β-estradiol levels were \nreduced at 2 weeks and further reduced at 4 weeks.  Female rats that had naturally high circulating estradiol had reduced \nserum 17- β-estradiol (25% to 58% in 2/8 rats) after 1 -week  oral administration of a Fucus vesiculosus  powder (350 \nmg/kg/day).  This p owder (700 and 1400 mg/day) increased the menstrual cycle length and reduced the days of menstruation \nin a dose -dependent manner in three female human subjects with hypermenorrhea, dysmenorrhea, and other related ailments.  \nIn one subject, the plasma estradiol levels were decreased and the progesterone levels were increased in a dose- dependent \nmanner.  \nIn an in vitro study examini ng the photo- protection potential involving a Sargassum muticum  extract, the effect of \nthis extract against cell death induced by UVB radiati on was studied.  Cell viability was 61% in UVB (150 mJ/cm2) irradiated \ncells and 70% in UVB -irradiated cells treated with Sargassum muticum  exract . Decreased numbers of apoptotic bodies as \nwell as DNA fragmentation was apparent in cells exposed to Sargassum muticum extract  and UVB versus UVB exposure \nalone.  \nIn vitro dermal irritation assays were performed on a mixture containing 24% Undaria Pinnatifida Cell Culture \nExtract in water; a mixture containing Laminaria Japonica (7%),  Nereocystis Leutkeana (7%),   Macrocystis Pyrifera Extract \n(7%),  and pentaerythrityl t etraethylhexanoate ; and a mixture containing Sargassum Filipendula Extract (1.3%), water \n(81.78%), sorbitol (14%), hypnea musciformis extract (1.4%), gellidiela acerosa extract (1.3%), m ethylparaben (0.2%), and \npropylparaben (0.2%).  These trade name mixtu res were considered to be non -irritating.  \nAscophyllum Nodosum Extract (4.7%), Laminaria Digitata Extract (0.5%) with dipropylene glycol and water or \nwater and sea salt, and Laminaria Digitata Extract  (0.5%) with artemisia vulgaris e xtract, phenoxyethanol , and water , were \nnon-irritating in animal dermal irritation studies.   Many human irritation studies were provided using test substances \ncontaining a brown algae ingredient, or combination of ingredients, along with other substances such as caprylic/capri c \ntriglycerides, butylene glycol, water, sea salt, propylene glycol, phenoxyethanol, panthenol, or dipropylene glycol. The \nmajority of these studies resulted in negative results; however, irritation was seen in several studies after treatment with high \nconcentrations or short periods of exposure.  In a study using a trade name mixture consisting of Fucus Spiralis Extract (< \n5%) in caprylic/capric triglycerides as the test substance, slight irritation was observed after 30 minutes, however, no \nirritation was  reported after 24 hours.  A trade name mixture containing 20% Himanthalia Elongata Extract, 37% Undaria \nPinnatifida Extract, and 43% water, was considered to be very slightly irritating to human skin.  When a test substance consisting of Laminaria Digitata Extract (1.5  - 2.5%) in water and propylene glycol was applied to the skin, moderate \nirritation was observed after 30 minutes, and slight irritation was observed after 24 hours. In a different study, Laminaria \nSaccharina Extract (1 -  3%) in water and propylene glycol was applied at concentrations of 8, 16, and 100% to 10 subjects. \nSlight irritation was observed at the 100% dose level, and no irritation was observed at the lower doses. When a trade name \nmixture containing Pelvetia Canaliculata Extract (1 -  3%) in propylene glycol and water was applied to the skin, moderate \nirritation was noted after 30 minutes, and slight irritation was noted after 24 hours. Similar results were observed when a trade name mixture consisting of Undaria Pinnatifida Extract (<  5%) in water and propylene glycol was applied to the skin of \n12 subjects. In a different study, the test substance (trade  name mixture containing Pelvetia Canaliculata Extract and \nLaminaria Digitata Extract extracted in propylene glycol with panthenol (th e amount of dry extract of both extracts combined \nis estimated to be 5.5  - 9.0%) ) was applied to the skin of 10 subjects at concentrations of 5, 10, and 100%. Mild irritation was \nobserved at the 100% concentration, minimal concentration was observed at the 10% concentration, and no irritation was \nreported at the 5% concentration.  \nAn ARE -Nfr2 Luciferase Test utilizing human keratinocyte cells at concentrations up to 2000 µM was performed to \nstudy the sensitization potential of Undaria Pinnatifida Cell Cultu re Extract (24%).   The test substance was considered to be \nnon-sensitizing. A DPRA performed testing the sensitizing potential of the same ingredient yielded negative results.  An \nARE -Nfr2 Luciferase Test was also performed on a trade name mixture containi ng Sargassum Filipendula Extract (1.3%), \nwater (81.78%), s orbitol (14%), Hypn ea Musciformis Extract (1.4%), gellidiela acerosa extract (1.3%), m ethylparaben \n(0.2%), and propylparaben (0.025%) .  No sensitization potential was observed.  Ascophyllum Nodosum Extract (25% -  75%)  \nand Agarum Cribosum Extract (3%) , was non -sensitizing when applied to the skin of 20 and 18 guinea pigs , respectively .  \nNo sensitization was noted when a cream containing 0.0023% Cystoseira Amentacea/Caespitosa/Brachycarpa Extract was applied to 25 animals in a maximization test.  All in vivo sensitization studies performed on humans, regarding several brown \nalgae ingredients (Alaria Esculenta Extract (0.5 -  2.5% and < 5%), Ascophyllum Nodosum Extract (0.5% -  75% ),  Cystoseira \nBaccata E xtract (0.5 – 10%), Cystoseria Compressa Extract (1 –  3%), Cystoseira Tamariscifolia Extract (0.5 -  10%), \nDictyopteris Polypodioides Extract (0.5 – 10%), Fucus Spiralis (1 -  3%), Fucus Vesiculosus Extract (5%),  Halidrys Siliquosa \nExtract (48%), Halopteris Scoparia Extract (0.5 -  10%), Himanthalia Elongata Extract (0.2%), Macrocystis Pyrifera (Kelp) \nExtract (4%),  Laminaria Digitata Extract (< 12%), Laminaria Ochrolueca Extract (< 5%), Laminaria Saccharina Extract (< \n3%), Pelvetia Canaliculata Extract (< 44%), Phyllacantha Fibrosa Extract (< 10%), Sphacelaria Scoparia Extract, Sargassum \nFilipendula Extract (1.2%),  Sargassum Muticum Extract (0.076%), and Undaria Pinnatifida Extract (< 5%)), were negative.   \nA phototoxicity study was performed according to OECD TG 432 using a trade name mixture containing 4.7% \nAscophyllum Nodosum  Extract in 94.5% water.  No phototoxic activity was reported.    Many in vitro HET -CAM tests were per formed.  The majority of these tests resulted in no irritation or slight \nirritation; however, some studies resulted in moderate irritation.  Moderate irritation was also noted when a cosmetic produc t \nconsisting of Laminaria Ochroleuca Extract (5%), capryli c/capric triglycerides (94.75%), and tocopherols (0.25%), was used \nin a HET -CAM assay.  Three ocular irritation assays performed using reconstructed cornea epithelium yielded negative \nresults.  \nAn Ascophyllum nodosum  extract ( 100 mg) administered to the eye s of rabbits had a maximum irritation  score of 6.7 \nout of 8 at 1 h post -instillation .  The score decreased to 0 by day 7  and was rated as a mild ocular irritant.   Ascophyllum \nNodosum Extract was slightly irritating in an ocular irritation study performed a ccording to OECD TG 405.  No other details \nwere provided for this study.  The ophthalmic irritation potential of an eye cream containing 0.076% Sargassum Muticum \nExtract was tested in 31 subjects.  The test material did not indicate a potential for ophthal mologic irritation and was \nconsidered safe for use by both contact and non -contact lens wearers.  A test substance diluted to 20% containing Lamin aria \nDigitata Extract (≤ 10%), artemisia vulgaris e xtract (≤ 10%), phenoxyethanol (0.8%), and water  was consid ered non -irritating \nwhen placed in the eyes of New Zealand White rabbits.  \nNo signs of edema or erythema were noted when a gel formulation containing 1% of an aqueous extract of Fucus \nvesiculosus  (0.2 mL) was applied to the cheeks of 10 female subjects.  I n oral human clinical trials, adverse effects of an \nAscophyllum nodosum  powder (0.5 g/d), an Ecklonia cava  extract ( up to 400 mg/day) , and an Undaria pinnatifida  powder \n(average intake 3.3 g/d) were mild and transient.  The adverse effects included nausea,  indigestion,  dyspepsia, and diarrhea.  \nDISCUSSION  \nThe Panel reviewed the ingredients in this repor t, and concluded that 68 of the 82 brown algae -derived ingredients \nare safe as used in cosmetics in the present practices of use.  The remaining  14 ingredient s were determined to have \ninsufficient data  to support  a conclusion  of safety .  Ingredient data profiles were  considered sufficient when either \ncomposition data, systemic toxicity data (via use in food, GRAS status, or oral toxicity), or sensitization data  were available.  \nIngredients lacking these data were considered to have insufficient safety data.   Additonally , if the necessary  data points were \navailable for an ingredient of a given genus and species, then all other ingredient forms with the same genus and species wer e \nalso found to be safe because of similarity in composition (e .g., Laminaria Digitata Extract and Laminaria Digi tata Powder).   \nTable 36 presents each ingredient, as well as a notation of the presence or absence of systemic toxicity data and sensitization \ndata.  \nThe Panel determin ed that concern for dermal sensitization or irritation is mitigated for those ingredients reported to \nbe used in foods.  The Panel supported this claim by clarifying that there are no case reports of adverse effects following \ningestion or handling of these  ingredients.  In addition, the Panel explained that the compositions of these brown algae are \nconsistent across the different genera, and no allergenic constituents were reported in the compositions of those ingredients . \nThe Panel noted that elevated levels of heavy  metals , arsenic, and pesticide residues may be present in these brown \nalgae -derived ingredients.  The  cosmetics industry should continue to use cGMPs to limit these impurities.  In addition, \npossible estrogenic effects were noted ; however, conc ern regarding  these effects w as mitigated as they were only seen at \nconcentrations much higher than w hat would be used in cosmetics.   Clinical studies suggesting the potential of toxic effects \nfrom exposure to iodine via consumption of brown algae as a dietary supplement were noted.  However, the systemic \nexposure to iodine via the  use of brown algae ingredients in cosmetics would be far less than that resulting from ingestion .  \nThe Panel also noted the presence of arachidonic acid  (which was previo usly found by the Panel to have insufficient data to \ndetermine safety) in  several of these brown algae ingredients , and determined that the concern can be mitigated as the final \nconcentration of this material would be minimal in cosmetic  formulation s.   \nThe Panel discussed the issue of incidental inhalation exposure from formulations that may be aerosolized (e.g., \nface/neck products at up to 0.79% (Macrocystis Pyrifera (Kelp) Extract ).  The Panel noted that in aerosol products, 95% – \n99% of droplets/particl es would not be respirable to any appreciable amount.  Furthermore, droplets/particles deposited in the \nnasopharyngeal or bronchial regions of the respiratory tract present no toxicological concerns based on the chemical and biological properties of these ingredients.  Coupled with the small actual exposure in the breathing zone and the \nconcentrations at which the ingredients are used, the available information indicates that incidental inhalation would not be a \nsignificant route of exposure that might lead  to local respiratory or systemic effects.

Frond is \ngenerally not strongly spiraled and receptacles do not have a sterile rim , and \nfrond does not have a serrated margin. Attached by a small, strong disc which gives rise to a short stipe. This species  is 15 to 90 cm long and 0.6 to \n2.5 cm wide. Reproductive receptacles are swollen areas at tips of fronds that have many flask -shaped cavities called conceptacles, which house male and \nfemale reproductive structures known as antheridia (borne on \nantheridiophores) and oogonia (containing 8 eggs), respectively. Eggs and \nsperm are liberated onto surface of receptacles and a pheromone (sex -\nattracting substance) is released by eggs that attract sperm. Fertilization \nresults in a zygote that forms a new Fucus  adult.

Button s, initially club -shaped but later mushroom -like, develop \nfrom zygotes in late summer, mature in winter, and begin to form \nreproductive receptacles in January/February. Some 4 -6 dichotomies are \nproduced at this stage, and fronds then elongate and thicken, developing no \nfurther branches, and become reproductively mature in July -September.  Northwest Atlantic Ocean (Scandinavia to Spain)  \nGently sloping rocks, particularly on semi -wave -\nexposed shore, on which they may form a distinct zone \nat low water.

Constituents in brown alg ae \nConstituent(s)  Description  \nAlkaloids  Tyramine (4 -hydroxyphenylethylamine) has been detected in Laminaria saccharina .172 The alkaloids found in marine algae may be divided into three groups: phenylethylamine \nalkaloids, indole and halogenated indole alkaloids, and other alkaloids.  \nAmino acids  Brown algae contain all of the essential amino acids and are great er in threonine, valine, leucine, lysine, glycine, and alanine than are the green and blue algaes.46 Fucus spiralis  was \nreported to contain 63.5% essential amino acids per total protein, containing leucine (5.5 mg/g protein), isoleucine (15.3 mg/g protein), lysine (12.5 mg/g protein), glutamic acid \n(12.1 mg/g protein), arginine (11.7 mg /g protein), serine (11.5 mg/g protein), valine (11.1 mg/g protein), and threonine (10.9 mg/g protein).173 \nBetaines  Glycinebetaine, γ -aminobutyric acid betaine, and/or trigonelline have been found in Alaria esculenta , Ecklonia maxima , Ecklonia radiata, Eisenia arborea , Laminaria digitat a \nMacrocystis pyrifera , Nereocystis luetkeana , Saccharina angustata , Saccharina japonica , and Undaria pinnatifida .174 \nIodine  The concentration  of iodine in Alaria esculenta  was reported to have a range of approximately 200 mg/kg (dry wt) to approximately 700 mg/kg (dry wt) depending on year, seaso n, \nlocation, and whether it was collected in the wild, a monoculture, or an integrated culture.175 Fucus vesiculosus contains between 0.03% and 0.2% iodine in dried m aterial.176 The \niodine content is highest in the spr ing in freshly cut young blades. In Laminaria digitata , iodine content is highest in late autumn and winter (0.75% to 1.20% dry wt) and lowest in \nsummer (0.25% to 0.60% dry wt).177 Iodine content for Fucus spiralis  and Laminaria ochroleuca  have been repo rted to be 232.7 and 883.5 mg/kg dry wt.173 \nLaminari ns Laminarins are basically a class of low molecular weight storage  β-glucans. These are composed of (1,3) -β-D-glucan and can be up to 35% of the dry weight of brown algae.178 \nLipids  Fucosterol and fucosterol derivatives are present in brown algae.46  Tocopherols, and sterols are also found in brown algae.  \nOmega -3 fatty acids  Omega -3 fatty acids include stearidonic acid and hex adecatetraenoic acid.179 These make up to 40% of the total fatty acid content in Undaria pinnatifida . \nPhenolic compounds, \npolyphenols, and phlorotannins  Phlorotannins are found in brown  algae.46   Flavonoids are integral structural components of cell walls (e.g., eckol, phlorofucofuroeckol A, dieckol, catechin, and epiga llocatechi n). \nPheromones  The pheromones include lamoxirene 4 (e.g., Agarum cribrosum , Ecklonia radiata , Eisenia arborea , Laminaria digitata , Laminaria hyperborea , Laminaria japonica , Laminaria \nsaccharina , Saccharina angustata , Undaria pinnatifida , Macrocystis pyrifera , and Nereocystis luetkeana ), fucoserratene 6 (e.g., Fucus serratus , Fucus spiralis , and Fucus \nvesiculosus ), hormonsirene 8 (e.g., Durvillaea antarctica ), and finavarrene 12 (Ascophyllum nodosum ). The major constituents of the essential oil of Dictyopteris polypodioides  are \nC11 hydrocarbons sulfur products such as 3 -hexyl -4,5-dithiacycloheptanone.28   \nPhytohormones  Auxins (plant hormones that cause the elongati on of cells in shoots and are involved in regulating plant growth), such as indoleacetic acid are found in the genera Macrocystis , \nLaminaria , Fucus , Ascophyllum ).46,180 Cytokin ins (genera Fucus , Ascophyllum , Sargassum , Macrocystis ), gibberellins (genus Fucus ), abscisic acid (genera Ascophyllum , \nLaminaria ), and polyamines (genus Dyctiota ) are also found.  \nPigments  Carotenoids including fucoxanthin, β -carotene, zeaxan thin, violaxanthin, and antheraxanthin are found in brown algae.46 These vary with season.  \nProtein  The protein content of algae varies according to  species and season.14,46 In general, the protein fraction of brown algae is low (1% to 24% dry wt.) compared with that of green or \nred algae (4% to 50% dry wt).  Except for the species Undaria pinnatifida , which has a protein content between 11% and 24% (dry wt.), most commercial brown algae have a \nprotein content lower than 15% (dry wt; e.g., Ascophyllum nodosum , 3% to 15%; Fucus vesiculosus , Himanthalia elongate , and  Laminaria digitata , 8% to 15%). The protein \ncontent of Fucus  sp. tend to range from 3% to 11% (e.g., Fucus spiralis , 9.71% dry weight).173 \nSterols  Sterols found in brown algae include desmosterol, ergosterol, fucosterol, cholesterol, campesterol, stigmasterol, and β -sterol.60,61   \nTerpenoids  Terpenes, phenolic compounds, and meroterpenes make up the three major classes of secondary metabolites in brown seaweed.46  \n \n  \n Table 9.

S poradic salivation occurred in \nfemales.  \n- At 1500 mg/kg /d, incidence of salivation in females increased and \noccurred in male rats. Salivation was mainly observed after gavage, \nbut to some degree also before. It was considered by authors to be a \ntemporary sign caused by the test substance, since it was no longer \nevident later in the day. Number of rats with salivation increased \nwith study duration.  \n-At 1500 mg/kg /d, males and females had a lower body weight \n(11.7% and 8.7%, respectively) at end of study com pared to \ncontrols (not statistically significant). This effect was dose related, \nappearing to a minor degree also at lower dose levels. Body weight \neffects were more pronounced in recovery group in both sexes. Feed \nconsumption was not decreased. Blood chem istry analyses showed \nincreases of phosphorus and ALT concentrations and  a decrease of \ntriglycerides in males, and a decrease of glucose in females , \ncompared to controls. Prothrombin time was increased in males \ncompared to controls. These changes were not evident after \nrecovery period.

Case Reports of brown algae  \nIngredient/substance (dose, if known)  Details  Reference  \nFucus vesiculosus supplement (1200 mg 3 \ntimes per day)  18-year-old female presented with polyuria, polydipsia, extreme faintness, and a general poor condition. She had been on a hypocaloric diet for 3 months and \ntaking Fucus vesiculosus supplements. Renal biopsy showed widespread tubular degeneration, and diffuse lymphomonocytic infilt rate; the glomeruli \ndisplayed scarce and focal mesangial proliferation, but the basal membrane appeared intact. The supplement was tested for heavy metals: arsenic, 21.3 \nmg/kg; cadmium, 0.3 ppm; mercury, 0.06 ppm; and chrome, 4 ppm. The patient recovered within 1 year.  245 \nKelp tablets  54-year-old female developed thrombocytopenia with mucocutaneous bleeding after ingesting kelp tablets ( that contained 1.3 µg/g arsenic) twice daily for 6 \nweeks. Marrow aspirate demonstrated normal megakaryocytes and dyserythropoiesis. After discontinuation of the supplements and  treatment with steroids \nand azathioprine, her platelet count recovered after 3 months.  150 \nKelp supplements  A 54 -year-old woman presented with a 2 -year history of worsening alopecia and memory loss. She also had a rash, increasing fatigue, nausea, and vomiting \nto the point of disablement. She took daily kelp supplements. A urine sample showed an arsenic level of 83.6 μg/g creatinine (normal < 50 μg/g creatinine). \nA sample from her kelp supplements contained 8.5 mg/kg arse nic. Within weeks of discontinuing the supplements, her symptoms resolved and arsenic blood \nand urine levels were undetectable.  151 \n  \nTable 34.

All -day urine sample was collected \non fourth day of run -in period and last day of  \ntreatment period (day 19) and  fasted blood samp les \nwere collected on fourth day of run -in period and on \nday after treatment period (day 20).   There was an increase in urinary iodine concentrations (median 140 mg/l \nvs78 mg/l) in the treatment group. TSH increased  slightly but within \nnormal range 2 subj ects. Increase in TSH concentrations may be \nassociated with iodine -induced hypothyroidism, especially in those \nsubjects with low iodine stores, although no change in the concentrations \nof thyroid hormones was observed. There were no adverse events \nreported  during this experiment.  152 \nEcklonia Cava \nExtract (400 \nmg/d) Alcohol  Subjects  with \nhyper -\ncholesterolaemia (n \n= 52)  Uncontrolled, open -label, single -arm study for 12 \nweeks  Hematological, clinical chemistry , and urinalysis did not reveal any \nadverse effects.

Compliance was not consistent; 6 subjects followed protocol; 1 ingested 9 \ncapsules /d, 2 ingested 8 capsul es/d, 6 ingested 6 capsules /d, and 3 \ningested 3capsules /d. Average intake was estimated to be 7.9 capsules or \n3.3 g /d. \n \nAverage SBP in treatment group decreased by 13 mmHg from the \nbaseline after 4 weeks, and was reduced by 8 mmHg below baseline after \n8 we eks. Average DBP decreased by 9 mmHg from baseline after 4 \nweeks and by 8 mmHg after 8 weeks. There were no significant changes \nin either SBP or DBP in control group.  However, the differences in reductions in SBP and DBP were significant between the treat ment group \nand control group.  Hypercholesterolemia subjects in treatment group had \ndecreased total cholesterol by 8% after 4 weeks; no changes were \nobserved in subjects with normal cholesterol levels.

Alan Andersen4\nAbstract\nThe Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel (Panel) reviewed the safety of a-amino acids, which function primarily as hair- and\nskin-conditioning agents in cosmetic products. The safety of a-amino acids as direct food additives has been well established based\non extensive research through acute and chronic dietary exposures. The Panel focused its review on dermal irritation and\nsensitization data relevant to the use of these ingredients in topical cosmetics. The Panel concluded that a-amino acids were safe\nas cosmetic ingredients in the practices of use and concentration of this safety assessment.\nKeywords\ncosmetics, a-amino acids, safety assessment\nIntroduction\nAmino acids and their salts are widely used as cosmetic ingre-\ndients and function primarily as hair-conditioning agents and\nskin-conditioning agents (humectant and miscellaneous).\nThe 21 most common naturally occurring amino acids are\nbuilding blocks of proteins. As such, amino acids are critical to\nlife and metabolic function. Eight of these amino acids, iso-\nleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine,\ntryptophan, and valine, are essential and must be obtained\nthrough nutrients, as they cannot be synthesized by human\ncells. Because amino acids are present in all living organisms\nand their general biology is well characterized, they are not\nconsidered to pose any significant safety concern following\noral exposure, except to individuals with certain genetic dis-\norders. Accordingly, this safety assessment focuses on the basic\nchemistry, uses as cosmetic ingredients, and, because of the\nimportance for products that will be applied to the skin,\naddresses all irritation and sensitization data available on these\n21 amino acids and their simple salts. The full list of the ingre-\ndients in this report is found in Table 1.\nThe naturally occurring protein amino acids are all a-amino\nacids and, with the exception of glycine and methionine, have\nL-stereochemistry at the a-carbon. The ‘‘ L-’’ amino acids are\nconsidered Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) direct food\nadditives by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), thus\noral toxicity was not a focus for these ingredients in this\nassessment.\nMonosodium glutamate (MSG) has been reported to be\nassociated with a human condition known as ‘‘MSG symptomcomplex’’ in which symptoms such as a burning sensation of\nthe face, neck, and chest; headache; and nausea occur after\nconsumption of large amounts of this amino acid salt in some\nfoods.1-3\nA rare genetic disorder, phenylketonuria, caused by a muta-\ntion in the gene that encodes phenylalanine hydroxylase, pre-\nvents affected individuals from converting phenylalanine to\ntyrosine.4If this disorder is not detected by blood testing during\nthe first few days after birth and proper dietary management is\nnot observed, irreversible neurological effects may occur.\nChemistry\nThe definition and structure of these ingredients are presented\nin Table 2, and available information on the physical and chem-\nical properties of amino acids and their salts is presented in\nTable 3.\nThe generic term ‘‘amino acid’’ is commonly considered\nshorthand for a-amino acid. This designates a carboxylic acid\n1Scientific Analyst/Writer, Cosmetic Ingredient Review, Washington, DC,\nUSA\n2Chemist, Cosmetic Ingredient Review, Washington, DC, USA\n3Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel Member, Washington, DC, USA\n4Director, Cosmetic Ingredient Review, Washington, DC, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nLillian J.

Glycine is achiral (no stereochemistry).\nL-Cysteine actually has Rstereochemistry due to the effect of\nthe sulfur atom on application of the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules\nused to define stereochemical configuration. The chirality of\namino acids is commonly denoted by the prefixes ‘‘ D-’’ and\n‘‘L-,’’ which indicate stereochemistry analogous to the Dand\nLforms of glyceraldehyde. According to this nomenclature, all\nof the ‘‘natural’’ a-amino acids have the Lconfiguration.\nExceptions are shown in Figure 2. Additionally, all of the nat-\nural amino acids contain primary amines (ie, acids with an NH 2\ngroup pendant from the acarbon), except proline, also shown\nin Figure 2, which is a secondary amine.\nCysteine and cystine are related as thiol (reduced monomer)\nand the disulfide (oxidized dimer) forms of the same structure.\nThese 2 molecules play major roles in reversible cellular redox\nchemistry as shown in Figure 3 and can serve a similar function\nin hairdressings, such as permanent waves.\nMethod of Manufacturing\nThe most common manufacture methodology for glutamine,\nhistidine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, serine, arginine, trypto-\nphan, phenylalanine, threonine, glutamic acid, and lysine is fer-\nmentation.5This method utilizes bacterial strains that\noverproduce and release, extracellularly, the desired amino acids\nduring carbohydrate metabolism. Cell separation and crystalliza-\ntion of the amino acids remove any concern of residual organ-\nisms or proteins in the end product. For example, glutamate can\nbe produced in a fermentation tank charged with a culture\nmedium including sugar and a culture of Corynebacteriumglutamicum . The extracellularly released glutamate is then sepa-\nrated from the biomass and crystallized.\nAlanine, methionine, valine, and aspartic acid, on the other\nhand, are most commonly manufactured via enzymatic cataly-\nsis.5This method utilizes active cell components in continu-\nously operating reactors. Often, these biocatalysts can be\nimmobilized to provide more efficient separations. This meth-\nodology also involves separation techniques that negate any\nconcern of organism or protein contamination in the end prod-\nuct. For example, methionine can be produced in an enzyme\nmembrane reactor with an acylase from Aspergillus oryzae and\neasily crystallized from the reaction mixture.\nCystine (and cysteine by reduction of cystine), asparagine,\nand tyrosine, however, are primarily obtained by extraction\nfrom the complete hydrolysis of proteins.5Glycine, the achiral\namino acid, is typically synthesized from chloroacetic acid and\nammonia.\nImpurities\nA supplier to the cosmetics industry reported that D-glutamic\nacid has not more than 0.3 %methanol.6\nAccording to the Food Chemic als Codex, United States\nPharmacopeia (USP)-grade amino acids (‘‘ DL-’’ and ‘‘ L-’’)\nmust be at least 98 %to 98.5%pure and contain no more than\n5m g /k gl e a d .7\nUse\nCosmetic\nThe amino acids and the salts discussed in this safety assess-\nment function primarily as hair-conditioning agents and skin-\nconditioning agents (humectant and miscellaneous) in cosmetic\nformulations.8Additional functions may include the use as oral\ncare agents (arginine), antioxidants (cysteine and cysteine\nHCl), hair waving/straightening agents (cysteine and cysteine\nHCl), reducing agents (cysteine and cysteine HCl), fragrance\ningredients (cystine), buffering agents (glycine and its calcium\nand magnesium salts), and pH adjusters (glycine and its cal-\ncium and magnesium salts).\nTable 4 presents the frequency and maximum use concen-\ntration ranges for amino acids.9,10According to information\nsupplied to the FDA by industry as part of the Voluntary Cos-\nmetic Registration Program (VCRP), arginine has the most\nreported uses in cosmetic and personal care products, with a\ntotal of 505 uses; 411 of those uses are in leave-on formula-\ntions.9Glycine has the second greatest number of overall uses\nreported, with a total of 364; 252 of those uses are in leave-on\nformulations. No uses were reported to the VCRP for sodium\naspartate, dipotassium aspartate, calcium aspartate, calcium\nglycinate, or magnesium glycinate. In a recent survey of use\nconcentrations, arginine had a maximum use concentration\nrange of 2.0 /C210/C05%to 18%, with the 18 %reported in paste\nmasks and mud packs.10Glycine had a maximum use concen-\ntration range of 5.0 /C210/C04%to 4%, with the 4 %reported inTable 1.

No use concentrations were\nreported for asparagine, sodium aspartate, dipotassium\naspartate, calcium aspartate, sodium glycinate, and magnesium\nglycinate. In some cases, reports of uses were received in the\nVCRP, but no concentration of use data were available. For\nexample, asparagine is reported to be used in 9 formulations,\nbut no use concentration data were available. In other cases, no\nreported uses were received in the VCRP, but a use concentra-\ntion was provided in the industry survey. For example, calcium\nglycinate was not reported in the VCRP to be in use, but the\nindustry survey indicated that it is used in leave-on formula-\ntions at up to 3 %. It should be presumed that calcium glycinate\nis used in at least one cosmetic formulation.\nProducts containing amino acids are reported to be used on\nbaby skin, may be applied to the eye area or mucous mem-\nbranes, or could be incidentally ingested. Additionally, amino\nacids are used in cosmetic sprays, including hair and other\npropellant and pump spray products, and could possibly be\ninhaled. The maximum concentration of amino acids reported\nto be used in a spray product is 0.3 %glycine in a face spray. In\npractice, 95 %to 99%of the droplets/particles released from\ncosmetic sprays have aerodynamic equivalent diameters >10\nmm, with propellant sprays yielding a greater fraction of dro-\nplets/particles <10 mm compared with pump sprays.11,12There-\nfore, most droplets/particles incidentally inhaled from cosmetic\nsprays would be deposited in the nasopharyngeal and bronchial\nregions and would not be respirable (ie, able to enter the lungs)\nto any appreciable amount.13,14\nNoncosmetic\nThe ‘‘ L-’’ amino acids are considered GRAS direct food addi-\ntives by the FDA and may be in the free, hydrated, or anhy-\ndrous forms or as the hydrochloride, sodium, or potassium salts\n(21 CFR §172.320). ‘‘ DL-’’ and ‘‘ L-’’ amino acids are described\nas food additives by the USP Food Chemicals Codex.7\nIn addition to food additives and supplements, amino acids\nalso may be used in the production of pesticides as source\nmaterials of chemical synthesis.15,16\nToxicological Studies\nThe amino acids in this assessment are found in foods, and the\ndaily exposure from food use would result in a much larger\nsystemic dose than that resulting from use in cosmetic products.Numerous studies and reviews have been published in the lit-\nerature about the safety of dietary exposure to amino acids,\nincluding a review by the Joint Food and Agriculture Organi-\nzation of the United Nations/World Health Organization Expert\nCommittee on Food Additives that summarized studies on oral\nacute and chronic exposure/carcinogenicity studies and geno-\ntoxicity and found no safety concerns for these substances at\nthe amounts they are used in flavoring agents.17Also, as noted\nearlier, the ‘‘ L-’’ amino acids are considered GRAS in direct\nfood additives by the FDA, and both ‘‘ DL-’’ and ‘‘ L-’’ amino\nacids are described as food additives in the USP Food Chemi-\ncals Codex. Consequently, the systemic toxicity potential is not\naddressed further in this report. The safety focus of use of these\namino acids as cosmetic ingredients is on the potential for\nirritation and sensitization.\nEnzyme Regulation\nIn an in vitro study using human keratinocytes, continuous\napplication of arginine ( L-) for 24 or 48 hours at concentrations\nof 10 to 50 mmol/L was found to increase endogenous intra-\nkeratinocytic urea synthesis through increased activity of ker-\natinocytic arginase.18\nIrritation and Sensitization\nIrritation\nDermal. Non-human irritation studies are presented in Table 5.\nThese data show tested ingredients to be nonirritating.\nOcular. Non-human and human ocular irritation studies are pre-\nsented in Table 6. The findings range from nonirritating to\nmoderately irritating.\nSensitization\nNon-human and human sensitization studies are presented in\nTable 7. No irritation was reported during induction, and no\nsensitization was reported at challenge.\nPhototoxicity\nPhototoxicity studies are presented in Table 8. No phototoxi-\ncity was reported.\nSummary\nAmino acids are critical to life and metabolic function. Because\namino acids are present in all living organisms, they are not\nconsidered to pose any significant safety concern following\noral exposure except to individuals with certain genetic disor-\nders, and their general biology is well characterized.\nThe amino acids and their salts are used primarily as hair-\nconditioning agents and skin-conditioning agents in cosmetic\nformulations. Arginine has the most reported uses in cosmetic\nand personal care products, with a total of 440. The maximumNH2O\nOHαβγ δ\nS-stereochemistry (L-)\nFigure 1. General structure for a-amino acids (see Discussion\nsection).52S International Journal of Toxicology 32(Supplement 4)use concentration range for arginine is 2.0 /C210/C05%to 18%.\nGlycine has the second greatest number of overall uses\nreported, with a total of 323, and has a maximum use concen-\ntration range of 5.0 /C210/C04%to 4%. The maximum concen-\ntration of amino acids reported to be used in a spray product is\n0.3%glycine in a face spray.\nThe ‘‘ L-’’ amino acids are considered GRAS in direct food\nadditives by the FDA. In addition to food additives and supple-\nments, amino acids may be used in the production of pesticides\nas source materials of chemical synthesis.\nAn in vitro study using human keratinocytes found that\ncontinuous application of arginine ( L-) increased endogenous\nintrakeratinocytic urea synthesis through increased activity of\nkeratinocytic arginase.\nCysteine HCl and methionine were used as negative controls\nin in vitro assays to predict potential skin irritants.\nIn separate efficacy studies, arginine, cysteine, and glycine\ndid not produce any adverse effects in rats, guinea pigs, or\nmouse skin models. Glutamic acid was used as a negative\ncontrol in an in vitro study to identify skin sensitizers.\nHuman repeat insult patch test studies of many products con-\ntaining amino acid ingredients concluded that products contain-\ning these ingredients were not dermal irritants or sensitizers.In several validation studies for in vitro phototoxicity\nassays, histidine was used as a negative control. Magnesium\naspartate up to 0.5 %and 1%tyrosine were not phototoxic in\nassays using yeast.\nDiscussion\nThe Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel (Panel)\nacknowledged that the safety of a-amino acids as direct food\nadditives has been well established based on extensive research\nthrough acute and chronic dietary exposures. The Panel deter-\nmined that this body of research, coupled with the available\nirritation and sensitization data and use concentrations that are\nat levels much lower than those consumed daily in the diet,\nwere a sufficient basis for determining the safety of a-amino\nacids in cosmetic products.\nThe Panel discussed the issue of incidental inhalation expo-\nsure from hair sprays, face and neck sprays, and suntan sprays.\nNo inhalation data were available. These ingredients reportedly\nare used at concentrations up to 0.3 %in cosmetic products that\nmay be aerosolized. The Panel noted that 95 %to 99%of dro-\nplets/particles would not be re spirable to any appreciable\namount.

The\nPanel considered other data available to characterize the\npotential for a-amino acids to cause systemic toxicity, irrita-\ntion, sensitization, or other effects. They noted that numerous\nstudies and reviews have been published in the literature\nregarding the safety of dietary exposure to amino acids,\nincluding studies on oral acut e and chronic toxicity, carcino-\ngenicity, and genotoxicity, which found no safety concerns\nfor these substances in the amounts at which they are con-\nsumed in flavoring agents. Additionally, little or no irritation\nor sensitization was observed in multiple tests of dermal and\nocular exposure. A detailed discussion and summary of the\nPanel’s approach to evaluating incidental inhalation exposuresto ingredients in cosmetic products is available at http://\nwww.cir-safety.org/cir-findings.\nThe Panel recognized that there are issues with sodium glu-\ntamate and phenylalanine in the diet for certain individuals.\nHowever, the Panel determined that the concentrations of these\namino acids in cosmetic products are at levels that would not be\nsignificantly absorbed through topical application or incidental\ningestion and, thus, would not cause systemic reactions in\nindividuals.\nAlthough the International Cosmetic Dictionary and\nHandbook does not distinguish among the a-amino acids used\nin cosmetics that are L-stereoisomers from those that are D-\nstereoisomers (or are mixtures of L-a n d D-stereoisomers), the\nPanel noted that the L-amino acids are GRAS direct food\nadditives by the FDA (except m ethionine which is GRAS as\na racemic mixture, and glycine which is GRAS and has noTable 4.

The safety of a-amino acids as direct food additives has been well established based\non extensive research through acute and chronic dietary exposures. The Panel focused its review on dermal irritation and\nsensitization data relevant to the use of these ingredients in topical cosmetics. The Panel concluded that a-amino acids were safe\nas cosmetic ingredients in the practices of use and concentration of this safety assessment.\nKeywords\ncosmetics, a-amino acids, safety assessment\nIntroduction\nAmino acids and their salts are widely used as cosmetic ingre-\ndients and function primarily as hair-conditioning agents and\nskin-conditioning agents (humectant and miscellaneous).\nThe 21 most common naturally occurring amino acids are\nbuilding blocks of proteins. As such, amino acids are critical to\nlife and metabolic function. Eight of these amino acids, iso-\nleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine,\ntryptophan, and valine, are essential and must be obtained\nthrough nutrients, as they cannot be synthesized by human\ncells. Because amino acids are present in all living organisms\nand their general biology is well characterized, they are not\nconsidered to pose any significant safety concern following\noral exposure, except to individuals with certain genetic dis-\norders. Accordingly, this safety assessment focuses on the basic\nchemistry, uses as cosmetic ingredients, and, because of the\nimportance for products that will be applied to the skin,\naddresses all irritation and sensitization data available on these\n21 amino acids and their simple salts. The full list of the ingre-\ndients in this report is found in Table 1.\nThe naturally occurring protein amino acids are all a-amino\nacids and, with the exception of glycine and methionine, have\nL-stereochemistry at the a-carbon. The ‘‘ L-’’ amino acids are\nconsidered Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) direct food\nadditives by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), thus\noral toxicity was not a focus for these ingredients in this\nassessment.\nMonosodium glutamate (MSG) has been reported to be\nassociated with a human condition known as ‘‘MSG symptomcomplex’’ in which symptoms such as a burning sensation of\nthe face, neck, and chest; headache; and nausea occur after\nconsumption of large amounts of this amino acid salt in some\nfoods.1-3\nA rare genetic disorder, phenylketonuria, caused by a muta-\ntion in the gene that encodes phenylalanine hydroxylase, pre-\nvents affected individuals from converting phenylalanine to\ntyrosine.4If this disorder is not detected by blood testing during\nthe first few days after birth and proper dietary management is\nnot observed, irreversible neurological effects may occur.\nChemistry\nThe definition and structure of these ingredients are presented\nin Table 2, and available information on the physical and chem-\nical properties of amino acids and their salts is presented in\nTable 3.\nThe generic term ‘‘amino acid’’ is commonly considered\nshorthand for a-amino acid. This designates a carboxylic acid\n1Scientific Analyst/Writer, Cosmetic Ingredient Review, Washington, DC,\nUSA\n2Chemist, Cosmetic Ingredient Review, Washington, DC, USA\n3Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel Member, Washington, DC, USA\n4Director, Cosmetic Ingredient Review, Washington, DC, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nLillian J.

Glycine is achiral (no stereochemistry).\nL-Cysteine actually has Rstereochemistry due to the effect of\nthe sulfur atom on application of the Cahn-Ingold-Prelog rules\nused to define stereochemical configuration. The chirality of\namino acids is commonly denoted by the prefixes ‘‘ D-’’ and\n‘‘L-,’’ which indicate stereochemistry analogous to the Dand\nLforms of glyceraldehyde. According to this nomenclature, all\nof the ‘‘natural’’ a-amino acids have the Lconfiguration.\nExceptions are shown in Figure 2. Additionally, all of the nat-\nural amino acids contain primary amines (ie, acids with an NH 2\ngroup pendant from the acarbon), except proline, also shown\nin Figure 2, which is a secondary amine.\nCysteine and cystine are related as thiol (reduced monomer)\nand the disulfide (oxidized dimer) forms of the same structure.\nThese 2 molecules play major roles in reversible cellular redox\nchemistry as shown in Figure 3 and can serve a similar function\nin hairdressings, such as permanent waves.\nMethod of Manufacturing\nThe most common manufacture methodology for glutamine,\nhistidine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, serine, arginine, trypto-\nphan, phenylalanine, threonine, glutamic acid, and lysine is fer-\nmentation.5This method utilizes bacterial strains that\noverproduce and release, extracellularly, the desired amino acids\nduring carbohydrate metabolism. Cell separation and crystalliza-\ntion of the amino acids remove any concern of residual organ-\nisms or proteins in the end product. For example, glutamate can\nbe produced in a fermentation tank charged with a culture\nmedium including sugar and a culture of Corynebacteriumglutamicum . The extracellularly released glutamate is then sepa-\nrated from the biomass and crystallized.\nAlanine, methionine, valine, and aspartic acid, on the other\nhand, are most commonly manufactured via enzymatic cataly-\nsis.5This method utilizes active cell components in continu-\nously operating reactors. Often, these biocatalysts can be\nimmobilized to provide more efficient separations. This meth-\nodology also involves separation techniques that negate any\nconcern of organism or protein contamination in the end prod-\nuct. For example, methionine can be produced in an enzyme\nmembrane reactor with an acylase from Aspergillus oryzae and\neasily crystallized from the reaction mixture.\nCystine (and cysteine by reduction of cystine), asparagine,\nand tyrosine, however, are primarily obtained by extraction\nfrom the complete hydrolysis of proteins.5Glycine, the achiral\namino acid, is typically synthesized from chloroacetic acid and\nammonia.\nImpurities\nA supplier to the cosmetics industry reported that D-glutamic\nacid has not more than 0.3 %methanol.6\nAccording to the Food Chemic als Codex, United States\nPharmacopeia (USP)-grade amino acids (‘‘ DL-’’ and ‘‘ L-’’)\nmust be at least 98 %to 98.5%pure and contain no more than\n5m g /k gl e a d .7\nUse\nCosmetic\nThe amino acids and the salts discussed in this safety assess-\nment function primarily as hair-conditioning agents and skin-\nconditioning agents (humectant and miscellaneous) in cosmetic\nformulations.8Additional functions may include the use as oral\ncare agents (arginine), antioxidants (cysteine and cysteine\nHCl), hair waving/straightening agents (cysteine and cysteine\nHCl), reducing agents (cysteine and cysteine HCl), fragrance\ningredients (cystine), buffering agents (glycine and its calcium\nand magnesium salts), and pH adjusters (glycine and its cal-\ncium and magnesium salts).\nTable 4 presents the frequency and maximum use concen-\ntration ranges for amino acids.9,10According to information\nsupplied to the FDA by industry as part of the Voluntary Cos-\nmetic Registration Program (VCRP), arginine has the most\nreported uses in cosmetic and personal care products, with a\ntotal of 505 uses; 411 of those uses are in leave-on formula-\ntions.9Glycine has the second greatest number of overall uses\nreported, with a total of 364; 252 of those uses are in leave-on\nformulations. No uses were reported to the VCRP for sodium\naspartate, dipotassium aspartate, calcium aspartate, calcium\nglycinate, or magnesium glycinate. In a recent survey of use\nconcentrations, arginine had a maximum use concentration\nrange of 2.0 /C210/C05%to 18%, with the 18 %reported in paste\nmasks and mud packs.10Glycine had a maximum use concen-\ntration range of 5.0 /C210/C04%to 4%, with the 4 %reported inTable 1.

No use concentrations were\nreported for asparagine, sodium aspartate, dipotassium\naspartate, calcium aspartate, sodium glycinate, and magnesium\nglycinate. In some cases, reports of uses were received in the\nVCRP, but no concentration of use data were available. For\nexample, asparagine is reported to be used in 9 formulations,\nbut no use concentration data were available. In other cases, no\nreported uses were received in the VCRP, but a use concentra-\ntion was provided in the industry survey. For example, calcium\nglycinate was not reported in the VCRP to be in use, but the\nindustry survey indicated that it is used in leave-on formula-\ntions at up to 3 %. It should be presumed that calcium glycinate\nis used in at least one cosmetic formulation.\nProducts containing amino acids are reported to be used on\nbaby skin, may be applied to the eye area or mucous mem-\nbranes, or could be incidentally ingested. Additionally, amino\nacids are used in cosmetic sprays, including hair and other\npropellant and pump spray products, and could possibly be\ninhaled. The maximum concentration of amino acids reported\nto be used in a spray product is 0.3 %glycine in a face spray. In\npractice, 95 %to 99%of the droplets/particles released from\ncosmetic sprays have aerodynamic equivalent diameters >10\nmm, with propellant sprays yielding a greater fraction of dro-\nplets/particles <10 mm compared with pump sprays.11,12There-\nfore, most droplets/particles incidentally inhaled from cosmetic\nsprays would be deposited in the nasopharyngeal and bronchial\nregions and would not be respirable (ie, able to enter the lungs)\nto any appreciable amount.13,14\nNoncosmetic\nThe ‘‘ L-’’ amino acids are considered GRAS direct food addi-\ntives by the FDA and may be in the free, hydrated, or anhy-\ndrous forms or as the hydrochloride, sodium, or potassium salts\n(21 CFR §172.320). ‘‘ DL-’’ and ‘‘ L-’’ amino acids are described\nas food additives by the USP Food Chemicals Codex.7\nIn addition to food additives and supplements, amino acids\nalso may be used in the production of pesticides as source\nmaterials of chemical synthesis.15,16\nToxicological Studies\nThe amino acids in this assessment are found in foods, and the\ndaily exposure from food use would result in a much larger\nsystemic dose than that resulting from use in cosmetic products.Numerous studies and reviews have been published in the lit-\nerature about the safety of dietary exposure to amino acids,\nincluding a review by the Joint Food and Agriculture Organi-\nzation of the United Nations/World Health Organization Expert\nCommittee on Food Additives that summarized studies on oral\nacute and chronic exposure/carcinogenicity studies and geno-\ntoxicity and found no safety concerns for these substances at\nthe amounts they are used in flavoring agents.17Also, as noted\nearlier, the ‘‘ L-’’ amino acids are considered GRAS in direct\nfood additives by the FDA, and both ‘‘ DL-’’ and ‘‘ L-’’ amino\nacids are described as food additives in the USP Food Chemi-\ncals Codex. Consequently, the systemic toxicity potential is not\naddressed further in this report. The safety focus of use of these\namino acids as cosmetic ingredients is on the potential for\nirritation and sensitization.\nEnzyme Regulation\nIn an in vitro study using human keratinocytes, continuous\napplication of arginine ( L-) for 24 or 48 hours at concentrations\nof 10 to 50 mmol/L was found to increase endogenous intra-\nkeratinocytic urea synthesis through increased activity of ker-\natinocytic arginase.18\nIrritation and Sensitization\nIrritation\nDermal. Non-human irritation studies are presented in Table 5.\nThese data show tested ingredients to be nonirritating.\nOcular. Non-human and human ocular irritation studies are pre-\nsented in Table 6. The findings range from nonirritating to\nmoderately irritating.\nSensitization\nNon-human and human sensitization studies are presented in\nTable 7. No irritation was reported during induction, and no\nsensitization was reported at challenge.\nPhototoxicity\nPhototoxicity studies are presented in Table 8. No phototoxi-\ncity was reported.\nSummary\nAmino acids are critical to life and metabolic function. Because\namino acids are present in all living organisms, they are not\nconsidered to pose any significant safety concern following\noral exposure except to individuals with certain genetic disor-\nders, and their general biology is well characterized.\nThe amino acids and their salts are used primarily as hair-\nconditioning agents and skin-conditioning agents in cosmetic\nformulations. Arginine has the most reported uses in cosmetic\nand personal care products, with a total of 440. The maximumNH2O\nOHαβγ δ\nS-stereochemistry (L-)\nFigure 1. General structure for a-amino acids (see Discussion\nsection).52S International Journal of Toxicology 32(Supplement 4)use concentration range for arginine is 2.0 /C210/C05%to 18%.\nGlycine has the second greatest number of overall uses\nreported, with a total of 323, and has a maximum use concen-\ntration range of 5.0 /C210/C04%to 4%. The maximum concen-\ntration of amino acids reported to be used in a spray product is\n0.3%glycine in a face spray.\nThe ‘‘ L-’’ amino acids are considered GRAS in direct food\nadditives by the FDA. In addition to food additives and supple-\nments, amino acids may be used in the production of pesticides\nas source materials of chemical synthesis.\nAn in vitro study using human keratinocytes found that\ncontinuous application of arginine ( L-) increased endogenous\nintrakeratinocytic urea synthesis through increased activity of\nkeratinocytic arginase.\nCysteine HCl and methionine were used as negative controls\nin in vitro assays to predict potential skin irritants.\nIn separate efficacy studies, arginine, cysteine, and glycine\ndid not produce any adverse effects in rats, guinea pigs, or\nmouse skin models. Glutamic acid was used as a negative\ncontrol in an in vitro study to identify skin sensitizers.\nHuman repeat insult patch test studies of many products con-\ntaining amino acid ingredients concluded that products contain-\ning these ingredients were not dermal irritants or sensitizers.In several validation studies for in vitro phototoxicity\nassays, histidine was used as a negative control. Magnesium\naspartate up to 0.5 %and 1%tyrosine were not phototoxic in\nassays using yeast.\nDiscussion\nThe Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel (Panel)\nacknowledged that the safety of a-amino acids as direct food\nadditives has been well established based on extensive research\nthrough acute and chronic dietary exposures. The Panel deter-\nmined that this body of research, coupled with the available\nirritation and sensitization data and use concentrations that are\nat levels much lower than those consumed daily in the diet,\nwere a sufficient basis for determining the safety of a-amino\nacids in cosmetic products.\nThe Panel discussed the issue of incidental inhalation expo-\nsure from hair sprays, face and neck sprays, and suntan sprays.\nNo inhalation data were available. These ingredients reportedly\nare used at concentrations up to 0.3 %in cosmetic products that\nmay be aerosolized. The Panel noted that 95 %to 99%of dro-\nplets/particles would not be re spirable to any appreciable\namount.

The\nPanel considered other data available to characterize the\npotential for a-amino acids to cause systemic toxicity, irrita-\ntion, sensitization, or other effects. They noted that numerous\nstudies and reviews have been published in the literature\nregarding the safety of dietary exposure to amino acids,\nincluding studies on oral acut e and chronic toxicity, carcino-\ngenicity, and genotoxicity, which found no safety concerns\nfor these substances in the amounts at which they are con-\nsumed in flavoring agents. Additionally, little or no irritation\nor sensitization was observed in multiple tests of dermal and\nocular exposure. A detailed discussion and summary of the\nPanel’s approach to evaluating incidental inhalation exposuresto ingredients in cosmetic products is available at http://\nwww.cir-safety.org/cir-findings.\nThe Panel recognized that there are issues with sodium glu-\ntamate and phenylalanine in the diet for certain individuals.\nHowever, the Panel determined that the concentrations of these\namino acids in cosmetic products are at levels that would not be\nsignificantly absorbed through topical application or incidental\ningestion and, thus, would not cause systemic reactions in\nindividuals.\nAlthough the International Cosmetic Dictionary and\nHandbook does not distinguish among the a-amino acids used\nin cosmetics that are L-stereoisomers from those that are D-\nstereoisomers (or are mixtures of L-a n d D-stereoisomers), the\nPanel noted that the L-amino acids are GRAS direct food\nadditives by the FDA (except m ethionine which is GRAS as\na racemic mixture, and glycine which is GRAS and has noTable 4.

Alan Andersen4\nAbstract\nThe Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel (Panel) asses sed the safety of 244 plant-derived fatty acid oils as used\nin cosmetics. Oils are used in a wide variety of cosmetic pro ducts for their skin condition ing, occlusive, emollient,\nand moisturizing properties. Since many of these oils are e dible, and their systemic to xicity potential is low, the\nreview focused on potential dermal effects. The Panel conc luded that the 244 plant-derived fatty acid oils are safe as\nused in cosmetics.\nKeywords\noils, safety, cosmetics\nIntroduction\nOils derived from edible vegetables, fruits, seeds, tree, and\nground nuts have been safely consumed by, and applied to\nthe skin of, humans for thousands of years. Although nuts,\nfruits, and vegetables themse lves may cause allergic reac-\ntions in certain individuals, the refined oils derived from\nthese plants generally pose no significant safety concern\nfollowing oral exposure, and their general biology is well\ncharacterized due to extensiv e use in food materials. Ini-\ntially used for anointing in re ligious ceremonies, oils and\ntheir components have also been used on the skin for their\nskin conditioning, occlusive, emollient, moisturizing, and\nother properties.\nThe full list of ingredients in this report, which includes\noils, hydrogenated oils, unsapon ifiables, oil fatty acids, and\nsalts of the fatty acids, is foun di nT a b l e1 .A l t h o u g hal a r g e\nnumber of oils derived from plants are included in this\nsafety assessment, there is a c ommonality in that they all\nare mixtures of triglycerides that contain fatty acids and\nfatty acid derivatives, the saf ety of which in cosmetics has\nbeen established. Thus, thi s safety assessment focused\nsolely on the basic chemistry, manufacturing and production\nmethods, uses, and irritation and sensitization potential of\nthese oils as used in cos metic ingredients.\nIn preparing this report, num erous inconsistencies were\nnoted with both taxonomic and In ternational Nomenclature\nCosmetic Ingredient (INCI) naming conventions. For exam-\nple, this report includes the macadamia nut ingredients,Macadamia integrifolia seed oil and Macadamia ternifolia\nseed oil, which are described in the International Cosmetic\nIngredient Dictionary and Handbook .1The species Mi n t e g -\nrifolia is currently the only species of macadamia nut which is\nused for oil production. The name M ternifolia is an old\nnaming convention for the edible nut that is currently used\nto describe a noncultivated, inedible species. Both Mi n t e g r i -\nfolia seed oil and Mt e r n i f o l i a seed oil are the same ingredient.\nSimilar naming conflicts have been discovered with Triticum\nvulgare (wheat) germ oil and Triticum aestivum (wheat) germ\noil,Orbignya oleifera seed oil and Orbignya speciosa kernel\noil, and Moringa pterygosperma seed oil and Moringa olei-\nferaseed oil, with these pairs being synonyms for each other.\nThe shea plant also has 2 species names, Butyrospermum\nparkii andVitellaria paradoxa .O n l y Bp a r k i i (asB parkii\n1Cosmetic Ingredient Review Scientific Analyst/Writer, Cosmetic Ingredient\nReview, Washington, DC, USA\n2Cosmetic Ingredient Review Senior Director, Cosmetic Ingredient Review,\nWashington, DC, USA\n3Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel Member, Cosmetic Ingredient\nReview, Washington, DC, USA\n4Cosmetic Ingredient Review Former Director, Cosmetic Ingredient Review,\nWashington, DC, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nBart Heldreth, Executive Director, Cosmetic Ingredient Review, 1620 L Street,\nNW, Suite 1200, Washington, DC 20036, USA.\nEmail: cirinfo@cir-safety.orgInternational Journal of Toxicology\n2017, Vol. 36(Supplement 3) 51S-129S\nªThe Author(s) 2017\nReprints and permission:\nsagepub.com/journalsPermissions.nav\nDOI: 10.1177/1091581817740569\njournals.sagepub.com/home/ijt\nTable 1.

For\nexample, sunflower oil contains high levels of vitamins A, D,\nand K, whereas palm oil is a rich source of vitamins A and E.\nCrude sunflower oil also has the highest content of vitamin E in\nthe form of a-tocopherol among vegetable oils.3\nVegetable oil and hydrogenated vegetable oil are cosmetic\nlabeling names for blends of plant-derived oils.5The composi-\ntion of a blend is determined by the desired physical properties.\nVegetable oil and hydrogenated vegetable oil may include, but\nare not limited to, canola oil, Brassica campestris (rapeseed)\noil,Carthamus tinctorius (safflower) seed oil, Helianthus\nannuus (sunflower) seed oil, Sesamum indicum (sesame) seed\noil,Elaeis guineensis (palm) oil, E guineensis (palm kernel) oil,\nCocos nucifera (coconut) oil, Gossypium herbaceum (cotton-\nseed) oil, Glycine soja (soybean) oil, Zea mays (corn) oil, Olea\neuropaea (olive) oil, Prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond)\noil, and hydrogenated products of these oils.\nMethod of Manufacturing\nThe oil may be directly expressed from the source (seed or\npulp) followed by solvent extraction. Bailey Industrial Oil and\nFat Products states that the removal of pigments and polar\nmaterials is mandatory for most cosmetic applications.6The\nprocess used for oil refining for foods may be adequate for this\npurpose, or additional steps may be required. Special refining\nmethods to yield colorless and odorless oils are used by the\ncosmetic industry and include proprietary adsorption chroma-\ntography and supercritical fluid extractions.\nThe majority of the oils presented in this report are produced\neither from mechanical extraction or solvent extraction or a\nhybrid of both methods, known as prepress solvent extraction.3\nIn solvent extraction, hexane is the most commonly used sol-\nvent, as it is economical and easily removed from the extracted\noil. Seeds that are rich in oil can be cold pressed to extract oil\nwithout the use of solvents.7\nAfter the initial extraction by methods such as solvent\nextraction, the crude (degummed) oil is often refined.3The first\nstep is treating the oil with caustic soda to neutralize free fatty\nacids, hydrolyze phosphatides, and remove some colored pig-\nments and unsaponifiable materials. Soap stock is usually a by-\nproduct of this step. The next step involves treating the neu-\ntralized oil with activated earth to further adsorb pigments. The\nlast major step in refining oil is deodorizing, usually by a type\nof steam distillation, which is intended to remove all oxidative\ncleavage products that impart odor or flavor to the oil. Deodor-\nization also removes tocopherols, sterols, and other minor con-\nstituents of free fatty acids and undesirable foreign materials.\nFigure 2 is a flowchart of the basic refinement process.\nAfter deodorization, oils can be further processed by hydro-\ngenation, which makes oil more resistant to oxidative and ther-\nmal damage, and by winterization, where oil is slowly cooled to\npromote formation of crystals that cause cloudiness, and then\nfiltered to remove the crystals.\nCosmetic grade fatty acid plant oils may include a physical\nrefining step that involves heating crude oil under vacuum.7This step allows for the removal of volatile components such as\ncolor compounds, odor compounds, and free fatty acids, which\ngives the refined oil a lighter color, less odor, and lower acid\nvalues.\nAnalytical Methods\nNear-infrared spectroscopy and gas chromatography have been\nused, respectively, to phenotype and analyze fatty acid profiles\nin shea fat (described as V paradoxa , not B parkii ).8The fatty\nacid composition of hazel seed oil ( Corylus avellana , in crude\nform) has also been analyzed by gas chromatography.9The\ntriacylglycerol and diacylglycerol composition oils from hazel-\nnut, pistachio, almond, Brazil nut, and macadamia nuts have\nbeen characterized using high-performance liquid chromato-\ngraphy with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization and\nUV detection.10The triacylglycerol profile of Brazil nut oil\nhas also been quantified using dry matrix-assisted laser deso-\nrption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.11\nImpurities\nProteins. Many edible fatty acid oils are derived from foods that\nare recognized as potent food allergens. It has been shown that\nan individual who is allergic to a food will generally not react\nto the refined oil, especially if the oil has been “hot pressed” or\nhas undergone more processing.12,13A prime example is Ara-\nchis hypogaea (peanut) oil. Peanuts are extremely allergenic to\na large population, but reaction to the oil is rare. In its safety\nassessment on A hypogaea (peanut) oil, the Panel noted that the\nmajor concern associated with allergic reactions to peanuts is\nthe protein.14The protein does not partition into the refined oil,\nand therefore, the oil is safe for use in cosmetics. However,\nresearchers have reported protein levels in processed oils. Hal-\nsey et al reported that Lowry protein determinations of cold-\npressed and refined sunflower oil were found to be 2 to 8 mg/\nmL protein,15whereas Zitouni et al reported trace amounts of\nprotein in the refined oil.16Olszewski et al found 0.1 to 0.2 mg\nprotein per gram of peanut oil,17whereas Ramazzotti et al\nreported finding immunoglobulin E (IgE)-responsive residual\nproteins in peanut oil extracts.18Porras et al found soy protein\nin some samples of soy oil, but not others.19Awazuhara et al\nreported 1.4 to 4.0 mg protein per 100 g of soy oil.20Although\nPaschke et al found approximately 35 mg/L protein content in\nrefined soybean oil, no IgE-binding activity was detectable.21\nAlthough the Panel has found a general lack of clinical\neffects for fatty acid oils already reviewed,14,22–30other groups\nhave raised concerns. The Eu ropean Medicines Agency\n(EMEA) Working Party on Herbal Medicinal Products con-\ncluded that soy and peanut products “should be treated as aller-\ngenic unless they have an analytically monitored non-\nallergenic specification and a safe maximum daily dose.”31The\nEMEA found that threshold concentrations for induction of a\nprotein contact dermatitis were not available and recom-\nmended, “all medications for topical use containing soya or\npeanut products should be treated as allergenic.”74S International Journal of Toxicology 36(Supplement 3)Aflatoxin. Aflatoxins are metabolic products of the molds Asper-\ngillus flavus andAspergillus parasiticus . They are most often\nproduced in stored agricultural crops (such as peanuts and other\nnut crops) when growth conditions and genetic requirements\nare favorable.32–34The International Agency for Research on\nCancer (IARC) categorized aflatoxins as group 1 agents,\n“carcinogenic to humans.”35,36\nThe US government places the following limitations on pea-\nnuts to be considered “negative” for aflatoxin: /C2015 ppb for\n“peanuts which have been certified as meeting edible quality\ngrade requirements” and /C2025 ppb for “nonedible quality\ncategories” (7 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) sections\n997.30 and 998.200).37Aflatoxin contamination was not a con-\ncern in the previous CIR safety assessments of peanut oil,17\nhazelnut oil,41or coconut oil.29\nGlycidol. Glycidol and glycidol fatty acid esters have been\ndetected in refined fatty acid oils.38–41\nGossypol. Gossypol reportedly is present in refined cottonseed\noil at a concentration of /C200.01%.24The concentration ofgossypol in modified cottonseed products intended for human\nconsumption is limited by federal regulation (21CFR 112.894).\nUse\nCosmetic\nThe safety of the cosmetic ingredients addressed in this safety\nassessment is evaluated based on data received from the US\nFood and Drug Administration (FDA) and the cosmetics indus-\ntry on the expected use of these ingredients in cosmetics. Use\nfrequencies of individual ingredients in cosmetics are collected\nfrom manufacturers and reported by cosmetic product category\nin the FDA Voluntary Cosmetic Registration Program (VCRP)\ndatabase. Use concentration data are submitted by the cosmetic\nindustry in response to a survey, conducted by the Personal\nCare Products Council, of maximum reported use concentra-\ntions by product category.\nThere are 244 oil ingredients included in this safety assess-\nment, 146 of which are reported to be used; 118 of the in-use\ningredients have never been reviewed by CIR, while 28 haveCrude  Oil \nDegummed Oil Lecithin Sludge \nAlkali Refined Oil Soap Stock \nSalad Oil \nCooking Oil Salad and \nCooking Oil Partially \nHydrogenated Oil \nOther Fatty Oil \nShortening \nStockBlended Oils \nMargarine Stock Bleached Oil Salad Oil Water\nAlkali \nDeodorizationDeodorization Deodorization \nDeodorization \nDeodorization \nDeodorization Activated Earth \nH2, Catalyst \nWinterization & \nDeodorization \nFigure 2.

For the ingredients being reviewed\nfor the first time, the frequency of use42and/or concentration of\nuse43–45can be found in Table 5. (Also included in Table 5 are 3\ningredients, Citrullus vulgaris (watermelon) seed oil, macada-\nmia nut oil, and Vaccinium oxycoccos (cranberry) seed oil, that\ndo not have identifiable INCI names; these ingredients are not\npart of this assessment, but they are very similar to the oils that\nare part of this assessment, and in f o r m a t i o no nt h e mi si n c l u d e di n\nthis report for completeness.) For the ingredients that have been\nreviewed previously, the current and historical23–26,28,46–48fre-\nquency and concentration of use is given in Table 6. The 97 ingre-\ndients not currently reported t o be used are listed in Table 7.42–45,49,50\nOf the oils included in this report, Bp a r k i i (shea) butter has\nthe most reported uses in cosmetic and personal care products,\nwith a total of 1,950; 1,680 of those uses are in leave-on\nformulations. A recent survey of use concentrations for B\nparkii (shea) butter reports a max imum use concentration of\n60%in leave-on products as a cu ticle softener, a manicuring\napplication.51Helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil has the\nsecond greatest number of overall uses reported, with a total\nof 1,414; 1,054 of those uses are in leave-on formulations,\nhaving use concentrations up to 96 %. Many other ingredients\nare used in an extensive number of formulations. For exam-\nple, prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil, O europaea\n(olive) fruit oil, and Gs o j a (soybean) oil have 1,127, 915, and\n912 uses, respectively. Most o f the in-use ingredients have\nuses in both leave-on and rinse-off product types, many are\nused in products that are applied around the eye and some are\nused in a way they can possibly be ingested. Some are used in\nproducts that involve mucous membrane exposure, and a few\nare used in underarm deodorant formulations. Many of the\nproducts are used in formulati ons at relatively high concen-\ntrations. Olea europaea ( o l i v e )f r u i to i li su s e da tu pt o1 0 0 %,\nPersea gratissima (avocado) oil is used at up to 98 %,H\nannuus ( s u n f l o w e r )s e e do i la tu pt o9 6 %,a n d Gs o j a (soy-\nbean) oil at 95 %.\nOils are used in a wide variety of cosmetic products for their\nskin conditioning, occlusive, emollient, moisturizing, and other\nproperties. Some of the oils included in this report are used in\nproducts that can be inhaled, and effects on the lungs that may\nbe induced by aerosolized products containing these ingredi-\nents are of concern. The particle size of aerosol hair sprays and\nof pump hair sprays is 38 and >80 mm, respectively, and is\nrelatively large compared to respirable particle sizes ( /C2010\nmm). Therefore, because of their size, most aerosol particles\nare deposited in the nasopharyngeal region and are not\nrespirable.\nNone of the oils, hydrogenate d oils, unsaponifiables, oil\nfatty acids, and salts of the fatty acids described in this report\nwere restricted from use in any way under the rules governing\ncosmetic products in the European Union.52\nNoncosmetic\nThe primary use of plant-derived fatty acid oils is for cooking.\nPalm oil is the world’s most widely consumed edible oil (41.7million metric tons), followed by soybean oil, rapeseed oil,\nsunflower seed oil, cottonseed oil, peanut oil, palm kernel oil,\ncoconut oil, and olive oil.3,53Nonfood, noncosmetic uses for\nedible fatty acid oils are found in Table 8.\nToxicological Studies\nMany of the fatty acid oils in this assessment are edible, and\nexposure to the oils from food use would result in a much larger\nsystemic dose than that resulting from use in cosmetic prod-\nucts. Consequently, their systemic toxicity potential, except as\ndiscussed below relating to carcinogenicity, is not addressed in\nthis report. The safety focus of use of these oils as cosmetic\ningredients is the potential for irritation and sensitization.\nCarcinogenicity\nThe safety of glycidol fatty acid esters in refined vegetable oils\nwas assessed by IARC. Glycidol was determined to be a group\n2A (probably carcinogenic to humans) chemical, while glyci-\nd o lf a t t ya c i de s t e r sw e r ed e t e r m i n e dt ob eag r o u p3( n o t\nclassifiable as to carcinogenicity to humans) chemical.40,41\nThe Federal Institute for Risk Assessment in Germany\nreleased a summary of their initial evaluation of the assessment\nof levels of glycidol fatty acid esters detected in refined vege-\ntable fats.39Although acknowledging that the levels of glycidol\nthat may be released from glycidol fatty acid esters are not\nknown, the evaluation noted that glycidol is classified as prob-\nably carcinogenic to humans. The evaluation was based on\nfindings of the German Chemical and Veterinary Test Agency\nthat noted that glycidol is converted to 3-chloropropanediol and\nit appeared to be the 3-chloropropanediol that was detected in\nthe vegetable fat.38The levels of 3-chloropropanediol were\nnegligible at the crude oil, degummed, neutralized, and\nbleached stages, but levels were significant at the deodorized\nstage.\nAnacardium occidentale (Cashew) Seed Oil\nThe modulatory effect of A occidentale (cashew) seed oil on\nantioxidant potential was investigated in female Swiss albino\nmice in a 120-day skin papillomagenesis study.54The mice\nwere divided into 4 groups of 15 and 1 group of 10 (vehicle\ncontrol). Test groups were as follows: group I was the vehicle\ncontrol, receiving 0.1 mL acetone; group II was the positive\ncontrol, receiving a single dose of 7,12-dimethylbenz( a)anthra-\ncene (DMBA; 0.005 mg/0.05 mL acetone) followed by appli-\ncations of 2 %croton oil 3 times a week until study termination;\ngroup III received a single dose of DMBA followed by appli-\ncations of 2.5 %cashew nut kernel oil 3 times a week until\nstudy termination; group IV received a single dose of DMBA\nfollowed by applications of 5 %cashew nut kernel oil 3 times a\nweek until study termination; and group V received 5 %cashew\nnut kernel oil applied until study termination. The oil was\napplied to the clipped dorsal scapular region that was 2 cm in\ndiameter. Body weights were recorded at regular intervals.76S International Journal of Toxicology 36(Supplement 3)Table 5.

Elaeis guineensis (palm) oil, 5%,\nwas nonallergenic in a maximization study23\nGossypium herbaceum (cotton) seed oil\nCosmetic formulations containing 3.4% to 8.97% hydrogenated cottonseed oil were not irritating to rabbit skin24\nOryza sativa (rice) bran oil\nUndiluted Oryza sativa (rice) bran oil was not irritating to rabbits, and in a guinea pig maximization study, no reactions were observed\nwhen 5% was used at induction and 25% and 50% Oryza sativa (rice) bran oil were used at challenge. An Oryza sativa (rice) bran oil/\nOryza sativa (rice) germ oil mixture, concentrations not stated, did not cause a contact allergy response. Undiluted hydrolyzed rice\nprotein was also not irritating or sensitizing25\nOryza sativa (rice) germ oil\nOryza sativa (rice) germ oil was not a primary dermal irritant25\nPrunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil\nUndiluted prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil and 2 moisturizer formulations, each containing 25% prunus amygdalus dulcis\n(sweet almond) oil, were tested for skin irritancy in rabbits using occlusive patches. Undiluted prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet\nalmond) oil was nonirritating (primary irritation index, PII ¼0/4). The formulations containing 25% prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet\nalmond) oil were minimally irritating (PIIs ¼0.28 and 0.72, respectively).\nIn a 60-day cumulative irritation test, 10% and 100% prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil was applied to rabbits. When tested\nin 7 separate trials, 100% prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil produced mean maximum irritation indices (MMIIs) ranging\nfrom 0.34 to 1.34 (maximum score ¼8). At a concentration of 10%, MMIIs for this ingredient ranged from 0 to 0.66. Results\nindicated that, when applied to the skin over a long period of time, prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil is slightly irritating;\nwhereas at 10%, it is practically nonirritating\nA maximization assay was used to determine the sensitizing potential of prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil using guinea\npigs. Intradermal induction used concentrations of 5% amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil, the dose-range phase of the\nexperiment used a single dermal application of 5%, 10%, or 100% Prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil, a booster induction\ninjection of 100% Prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil was applied occlusively for 48 hours 1 week later, challenge was\nwith 5% prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil in petrolatum applied topically under occlusion for 24 hours. Prunus amygdalus\ndulcis (sweet almond) oil was nonsensitizing\nUndiluted prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil was tested for irritancy in groups of 6 male albino rabbits. The test material\nwas applied under occlusion to the clipped intact and abraded dorsal skin of each animal. Twenty-three hours later, patches were\nremoved; sites were scored at 24 and 48 hours. The primary irritation indices (PIIs) for 7 test samples of prunus amygdalus dulcis\n(sweet almond) oil ranged from 0 to 0.18 (maximum score ¼8), indicating that this ingredient is practically nonirritating to skin208\n(continued)Burnett et al 95Sguinea pig skin, and 5 %aqueous solutions of a bar soap con-\ntaining 13 %sodium cocoate had irritation scores of 1.6 to 4.0\nof 8 in animal studies. However, the majority of the remaining\nanimal irritation and/or sensitization studies conducted on a\nlarge number of the oils included in this report, primarily in\nformulation, did not report any significant irritation or sensiti-\nzation reactions, indicating that refined oils derived from plants\nare not dermal irritants or sensitizers. None of the tested oils,\nincluding B parkii (shea) butter (up to 20 %) and Oryza sativa\n(rice) germ oil ( /C2075%), were phototoxic in animal studies. The\ncomedogenicity of C avellana (hazel) seed oil was evaluated\nusing rabbits, and a slight difference in the number and size of\nthe pilosebaceous follicles and a slight excess of sebum and a\ndilation of the follicles were observed.\nHuman\nPlant-derived fatty acid oils are commonly believed to be safe\nfor use on the skin.6de Groot notes that no documentation\nexists to show that high-quality edible lipids cause adverse\nreactions in normal individuals (except for potential comedo-\ngenicity).55Very few reports of adverse reactions to cosmetic\nuse of edible fatty acid oils have been reported.\nMany plant-derived fatty acid oils are derived from foods\nthat are recognized as potent food allergens. The allergic reac-\ntions are thought to be caused by the proteins present in the\nfood. It has been shown that an individual who is allergic to a\nfood will generally not react to the refined oil, especially if theoil has been “hot pressed” or has undergone more process-\ning.12,13In its safety assessment on A hypogaea (peanut) oil,\nthe Panel noted that while peanuts are extremely allergenic to a\nlarge population, reaction to the oil is rare. The major concern\nassociated with allergic reactions to peanuts is the protein,14\nwhich does not partition into the refined oil; therefore, the oil is\nsafe for use in cosmetics. Crevel et al also concluded that\nchemically refined peanut oil is safe for the majority of peanut\nallergic individuals.13They stated that “as peanut is acknowl-\nedged to be one of the most potent food allergens, it is reason-\nable to extrapolate the conclusions drawn up for peanut oil to\nother edible oils.” However, they concede that validated ana-\nlytical methodology for establishing the protein content of oil is\nneeded.\nIn support of the conclusions stated earlier, Crevel et al also\nexamined the allergenicity of some other oils. Very few\ninstances of allergic reactions to other major edible fatty acid\noils have been reported. Even sesame oil, which differs from\nthe other oils, is used as a flavorant and, therefore, is not\nrefined, is expected to contain significantly more protein than\nthe other edible fatty acid oils, and has had very few reports of\nallergic reaction. Additional studies demonstrating safety are\nsummarized later in this section.15,56\nA large number of clinical irritation and sensitization studies\nwere made available on many of the oils, primarily in formula-\ntion, and these studies are summarized in Table 11. All of the\ndata indicated that the oils were not irritants or sensitizers.\nSummary statements of human dermal studies, includingTable 10.

Although\nthe majority of the oils were nonirritating to mildly irritating, a few\nstudies indicated some significant irritation. For example, a lotion\ncontaining 1.5 %E guineensis (palm) oil was moderately irritating\nto rabbit eyes, and a mascara containing 9.4 %Linum usitatissimum\n(linseed) seed oil was predicted to be moderately irritating in an\nalternative assay. Available ocu lar irritation studies are summar-\nized in Table 13. Summary statements of ocular irritation studies\nfrom previous CIR reports on oils are provided in Table 14.\nHuman\nIn clinical ocular irritation studies, formulations containing\n9.4%L usitatissimum (linseed) oil and 0.2 %Ribes nigrum\n(blackcurrant) seed oil did not produce adverse reactions and\nwere considered safe for contact lens wearers. These studies are\nalso summarized in Table 13.\nClinical Studies\nClinical Trials/Case Studies\nPlant-derived fatty acid oils have been used as vehicles for\ndelivery of therapeutic agents or used alone in treating skin\ndisorders. Adverse reactions to the oils were notably absentin such clinical tests. Case studies have reported isolated aller-\ngic reactions. The available data are summarized in Table 15.\nSummary\nThe report addresses the safety of plant-derived fatty acid oils.\nThese oils, which are derived from vegetable and fruit plants,\nare composed of monoglycerides, diglycerides, and primarily\ntriglycerides, free fatty acids, and other minor components,\nincluding natural antioxidants and fat-soluble vitamins. The\npercentage of chemical constituents and nutritional content of\nindividual oil types is dependent on region where the oil plant\nis grown, individual cultivars, and plant genetics. Oils used in\ncosmetics are likely produced in the same manner as those used\nin the food industry. Oils may be expressed through mechanical\nor solvent extraction. The oils may undergo further refining,\nsuch as neutralizing, bleaching, and deodorizing, to remove pig-\nments, odors, unsaponifiable materials, and other undesirables.\nSo that all plant-derived fatty acid oils that are cosmetic\ningredients are included in 1 report, several ingredients that\nhave been reviewed previously by the Panel are included in\nthis report. The ingredients, their conclusions, and citations are\nfound in Table 2. Some study results utilized in those previous\nsafety assessments were also utilized in this safety assessment\nand cited below where appropriate.\nIndividuals who have food allergies to a plant protein rarely\nexhibit allergic reactions when exposed to refined oils of the\nsame plant. Data evaluation by the Panel regarding the method\nof manufacture indicates that protein constituents do not parti-\ntion into the refined oils. The Panel has also found a general lack\nof clinical effects for fatty acid oils that they have already\nreviewed; however, other researchers have raised concerns about\nthe presence of residual proteins in oils, such as peanut and soy.Table 11.

Cosmetic formulations\ncontaining 10.6% to 20.86% hydrogenated cottonseed oil were not irritating or sensitizing.24\nOryza sativa (rice) bran oil\nRice is generally regarded as hypoallergenic, although some case studies of allergic reactions to raw rice have been reported. In\nclinical testing, formulations containing 1.04% to 8.0% Oryza sativa (rice) bran oil were not irritating or sensitizing. Hydrolyzed rice\nprotein was not irritating to human participants.25\nPersea gratissima (avocado) oil\nPersea gratissima (avocado) oil was not an irritant or sensitizer when human participants were patch tested with cosmetic\nformulations containing up to 10.7% Persea gratissima (avocado) oil or in patch tests using 100% Persea gratissima (avocado) oil.27\nPrunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil\nUndiluted Prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil was nonirritating in a single insult patch test with 101 participants, and it was\nnonirritating and nonsensitizing in an HRIPT using 52 participants. Cosmetic formulations containing 0.1% to -5% were practically\nnonirritating and nonsensitizing in HRIPTs performed with 6,906 participants.

The safety focus of use\nof these oils as cosmetic ingredients is on the potential for\nirritation and sensitization. Undiluted, technical grade, A hypo-\ngaea (peanut) oil was moderately irritating to rabbits and gui-\nnea pig skin, and 5 %aqueous solutions of a bar soap containing\n13%sodium cocoate had irritation scores of 1.6 to 4.0 of 8 in\nanimal studies. However, the majority of the remaining animal\nirritation and/or sensitization studies conducted on a large num-\nber of the oils included in this report, primarily in formulation,\ndid not report any significant irritation or sensitizationreactions, indicating that refined oils derived from plants are\nnot dermal irritants or sensiti zers. None of the tested oils,\nincluding B parkii (shea) butter (up to 20 %) and O sativa (rice)\ngerm oil ( /C2075%), were phototoxic in animal studies. The\ncomedogenicity of C avellana (hazel) seed oil was evaluated\nusing rabbits, and a slight difference in the number and size of\nthe pilosebaceous follicles and a slight excess of sebum and a\ndilation of the follicles were observed.\nThe results of a large number of clinical irritation, sensitiza-\ntion, and photoxicity/photosensitziation studies indicated that\nplant-derived fatt acid oils were not irritants or sensitizers in\nhumans. In clinical testing with an eye mask containing 0.2 %\nRibes nigrum (blackcurrant) seed oil (undiluted), the formula-\ntion was noncomedogenic.Table 14.

An eye mask containing 0.2 %R nigrum (black-\ncurrant) seed oil (undiluted) was tested and considered safe for\ncontact lens wearers.\nPlant-derived fatty acid oils have been used as vehicles for\ndelivery of therapeutic agents or used alone in treating skin\ndisorders. Adverse reactions to the oils were notably absentin such clinical tests. Case studies have reported isolated aller-\ngic reactions.\nDiscussion\nPlant-derived fatty acid oils, oils which have been hydroge-\nnated to reduce or eliminate unsaturation, fatty acid salts, and\noil unsaponifiables were reviewed by the Panel. Most of these\ningredients in this report are mixtures of triglycerides contain-\ning fatty acids and fatty acid derivatives, the safety of which in\ncosmetics has been established. Upon review of these ingredi-\nents, the Panel expressed concern regarding gossypol (for\ncotton-derived ingredients), pesticide residues, and heavy\nmetals that may be present in botanical ingredients. The Panel\nstressed that the cosmetics industry should continue to use theTable 15. (continued)\nIngredient Patients/condition Effect/observation Reference\nOlea europaea (olive) fruit oil\nOlea europaea (olive) fruit oil Throughout the literature, it is stated that sensitization to\nOlea europaea (olive) fruit oil is considered rare. Case\nreports have been described, however, and generally\ninvolved patients with venous eczema, some type of\ndermatitis or lesion, or an occupational exposure. Patch\ntesting with Olea europaea (olive) fruit oil produced positive\nreactions in most of these cases, and these results were\nusually regarded as allergenic. The concentrations of Olea\neuropaea (olive) fruit oil tested were not always given, but,\nwhen stated, test concentrations giving positive results,\nranged from 30% to100%. When the constituents of olive oil\nwere tested as well, the results of that testing were negative.318–325\nOlea europaea (olive) fruit oil Whether the reactions to olive oil were contact\nsensitization or irritation were investigated using open and\nocclusive testing. It was concluded that olive oil presented as\na weak irritant rather than a contact sensitizer in the few\ncase studies was observed.326\nPersea gratissima (avocado) oil\nPersea gratissima (avocado)\noil1 female; dermatitis around the\neyes and earlobesPatch testing with her sunscreen resulted in positive results. In\nsubsequent patch testing of the ind ividual ingredients, a positive\nreaction to undiluted oil, but not to the active ingredient, was\nobserved; 20 control participants were involved, and reactions\ntoPersea gratissima (avocado) oil were not seen.327\nSesamum indicum (sesame) seed oil\nSesamum indicum (sesame)\nseed oil in an ointmentFemale Pruritic erythema, papules, and vesicles appeared after\napplication of the ointment; patch testing was performed\nwith the ointment and with the individual ingredients,\nincluding undiluted Sesamum indicum (sesame) seed oil.\nBoth the ointment and Sesamum indicum (sesame) seed oil\nproduced positive reactions on days 2, 3, 4, and 1; the other\ncomponents did not cause a reaction.\nResults were negative in patch testing of Sesamum indicum\n(sesame) seed oil using 20 healthy participants.328\nAbbreviations: IgE, immunoglubulin E; IgG4, immunoglobulin G4.114S International Journal of Toxicology 36(Supplement 3)necessary procedures to limit these impurities in the ingredient\nbefore blending into cosmetic formulations.\nAdditionally, the Panel considered the safety of glycidol\nand glycidol fatty acid esters in refined vegetable oils.\nAlthough the Panel recognizes that these impurities may be\ncarcinogenic, absorption through the skin would be very low\nand likely does not pose a significant hazard. Nonetheless,\nsuppliers should take steps to eliminate or reduce the presence\nof glycidol and glycidol fatty acid esters in plant-based fatty\nacid oils that are used in cosmeti c products. Aflatoxins, which\nare potent carcinogens, may be present in moldy nuts and\ncoconut copra but are not found i no i l se x p r e s s e df r o mt h e s e\nnuts and copra. The Panel adopted the US Department of\nAgriculture designation of /C2015 ppb as corresponding to\n“negative” aflatoxin content.\nCertain plant-derived oils are used in cosmetic products that\nmay be inhaled during their use. In practice, however, the par-\nticle sizes produced by the cosmetic aerosols are not respirable.\nThe Panel discussed the relationship between food allergies\nand exposure to refined oils. Individuals who have food aller-\ngies to a plant protein rarely exhibit allergic reactions when\nexposed to refined oils of the same plant. The Panel has found a\ngeneral lack of clinical effects for plant-derived fatty acid oils\nalready reviewed.\nFatty acid composition data were available for the majority\nof the oils included in this review and the Panel agreed that the\ncomposition data, in combination with the available data on\nmethod of manufacture, impur ities, safety test data, a long\nhistory of safe use in foods, and an absence of adverse reactions\nin clinical experience, were a sufficient basis for determining\nsafety. The Panel did note that vegetable oil is a blend of a\nnumber of different oils and that a specific composition of\nvegetable oil was not available. The Panel determined that the\nsafety of vegetable oil as used in cosmetic formulations has\nbeen established, providing t hat the blend contains oils for\nwhich the fatty acid composition is known.\nAdditionally, although data on th e fatty acid composition of\nFragaria vesca (strawberry) seed oil and Fragaria virginiana\n(strawberry) seed oil were not available, data were available for\nFragaria ananassa (strawberry) seed oil and Fragaria chiloensis\n(strawberry) seed oil. In that the fatty acid compositions of F ana-\nnassa andF chiloensis (strawberry) seed oil were similar to each\nother and it was assumed that Fv e s c a andF virginiana (strawberry)\nseed oils would also have similar fatty acid compositions.\nThe Panel also noted that arachidonic acid is a fatty acid\nconstituent of Lycium barbarum seed oil, O sativa (rice) germ\noil, and Sclerocarya birrea seed oil. Although a previously\npublished CIR evaluation concluded that insufficient data exist\nto support the safety of arachidonic acid in cosmetic products,\nthe Panel was of the opinion that the concentration of use of\nthese ingredients was sufficiently low that the amount of free\narachidonic acid from these oils would not warrant concern.\nFinally, the conclusion reached by the Panel on the safety of\nthe plant-derived fatty acid oils supersedes the 2001 conclusion\nof insufficient data for Corylus americana and C avellana\n(hazel) seed oil.Conclusion\nThe Panel concluded that the 244 plant-derived fatty acid oils\nincluded in this review are safe in the present practices of use\nand concentration described in this safety assessment. Were\ningredients not in current use (as indicated by *) to be used\nin the future, the expectation is that they would be used in\nproduct categories and concentrations comparable to others\nin this group.

Alan Andersen4\nAbstract\nThe CIR Expert Panel assessed the safety of dicarboxylic acids and their salts and esters as used in cosmetics. Most dicarboxylic\nacids function in cosmetics as pH adjusters or fragrance ingred ients, but the functions of most of the salts in cosmetics are not\nreported. Some of the esters function as skin conditioning or fragr ance ingredients, plasticizers , solvents, or emollients. The\nExpert Panel noted gaps in the available safety data for some of the dicarboxylic acid and their salts and esters in this safety\nassessment. The available data on many of the ingredients are sufficient, however, and s imilar structural activity relationships,\nbiologic functions, and cosmetic product usage suggest that th e available data may be extrapolated to support the safety of the\nentire group. The Panel concluded that the ingredients nam ed in this report are safe in the present practices of use and\nconcentration.\nKeywords\nfinal report of the cosmetic ingredient review expert panel on the safety assessment of dicarboxylic acids, salts and esters, safety,\ncosmetics\nIntroduction\nThe safety of sebacic acid and other alkyl a,o-dicarboxylic\nacids, and their salts, monoesters and diesters as used in cos-\nmetics, has been reviewed by the CIR Expert Panel (the Panel).\nThe dicarboxylic acids are terminally functionalized straight\nalkyl chains characterized by a separation between the car-\nboxylic acid functional groups of 1 to 10 carbons (1 carbon\nseparation, 3 carbons total (C3) ¼malonic acid; 2 carbons\nseparation (C4) ¼succinic acid; 3 carbons separation (C5) ¼\nglutaric acid; 4 carbons separation (C6) ¼adipic acid; 7 car-\nbons separation (C9) ¼azelaic acid; 8 carbons separation\n(C10) ¼sebacic acid; and 10 carbons separation (C12) ¼\ndodecanedioic acid). The simple alkyl diesters are the result\nof the condensation of alkyl dicarboxylic acids and 2 equiva-\nlents of alkyl alcohols. The simple alkyl esters (mono- and di-)\nof these dicarboxylic acids have straight or branched side\nchains ranging in length from 1 to 18 carbons. Throughout this\nreport, the data are presented by order of acid chain length (ie,\nbeginning with malonic acid and ending with dodecanedioic\nacid; and beginning with dime thyl malate and ending with\ndiisocetyl dodecanedioate).This report presents available information in 2 groups, the\n12 alkyl dicarboxylic acids/salts and the 44 corresponding\n(mono- and di-) esters.\nThe alkyl dicarboxylic acids and salts include:\n/C15malonic acid\n/C15succinic acid\n/C15sodium succinate\n/C15disodium succinate\n/C15glutaric acid\n/C15adipic acid\n/C15azelaic acid\n1Scientific Analyst/Writer, Cosmetic Ingredient Review\n2Chemist, Cosmetic Ingredient Review\n3The 2011 Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel member\n4Director, Cosmetic Ingredient Review\nCorresponding Author:\nF.

CAS numbers, definitions, structures\nand functions for the alkyl dicarboxylic acid, salt, and ester\ningredients included in this report are given in Table 1.\nA safety assessment of diethylhexyl adipate (often inaccu-\nrately named dioctyl adipate)1and diisopropyl adipate was\npublished in 1984, with the conclusion that these ingredients\nare safe as used in cosmetics.2The safety of these ingredients\nwas re-reviewed and confirmed in 20053and 2006.4Addition-\nally, dibutyl adipate was originally reviewed in 1996, and at\nthat time the available data were found insufficient to support\nthe safety of dibutyl adipate in cosmetic formulations. When\nre-reviewed in 2006, additional data were made available to\naddress the data needs identified by the CIR Expert Panel, and\nan amended conclusion was issued stating that dibutyl adipate\nis safe for use in cosmetic formulations.5\nIn order to focus on the acids and their salts separately from\nthe dicarboxylic acid esters, this report is presented in 2 sections.\nPart I: Alkyl Dicarboxylic Acids and\ntheir Salts\nChemistry\nMethod of Manufacture\nWhile many of the alkyl dicarboxylic acids are present in nat-\nural sources, commercial production of these acids has histori-\ncally occurred via alkali pyrolysis of lipids.6For example,\nwhen castor oil (a lipid which is comprised of approximately\n84%ricinoleic acid side chain bearing triglycerides) is pyrolyzed\nwith sodium hydroxide, some of the major products are sebacic\nacid and 2-octanol (Figure 1).6Sodium and potassium salts of\nthe alkyl dicarboxylic acids are readily prepared via addition to\nthe appropriate stoichiometric equivalent/equivalents of sodium\nhydroxide or potassium hydroxide, respectively.\nSome of the ingredients in this assessment are tallow deriva-\ntives. The CIR accepts the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\ndetermination (21 CFR 700.27(a)) that tallow derivatives are not\nprohibited cattle materials and may be used in cosmetics.\nMalonic acid (C3). Malonic acid, first prepared by malic acid\noxidation, is commonly manufactured by more recent methods\nincluding the ozonolysis of cyclopentadiene or the air oxidation\nof 1,3-propanediol.7\nSuccinic acid (C4). Succinic acid is an intermediate of the\ncitric acid cycle and is found in almost all plant and animal\ncells, although at very low concentrations.8Succinic acid is\ncommonly produced synthetically by catalytic (eg, nickel or\npalladium catalyst) hydrogenation of maleic anhydride.\nGlutaric (C5) and adipic(C6) acids. Although glutaric acid is\noften encountered in nature, adipic acid is not commonly\nencountered in nature. Glutaric and adipic acids were first\nsynthesized by oxidation of castor oil with nitric acid. How-\never, adipic acid is now more commonly manufactured by the6S International Journal of Toxicology 31(Supplement 1)Table 1.

Azelaic acid, first detected in rancid fats,\nwas originally produced via nitric acid oxidation of oleic\nacid.10Azelaic acid is a naturally occurring dicarboxylic acid\nthat can be found in dietary sources, such as whole grains.11\nAzelaic acid is commonly manufactured by oxidative cleavage\nof oleic acid (obtained from grease or tallow) with chromic\nacid, nitric acid, or by ozonolysis.10,7\nSebacic acid (C10). Sebacic acid was originally isolated from\ndistillation products of beef tallow. More recently, however,\nsebacic acid has been manufact ured via alkali pyrolysis of\ncastor oil, as mentioned above and drawn in Figure 1, or by\nalkali pyrolysis of ricinoleic acid.12,7\nDodecanedioic acid (C12). Dodecanedioic acid can be manu-\nfactured by fermentation of long-chain alkanes with a specific\nstrain of Candida tropicalis .13Another method of manufactureinvolves the nitric acid oxidation of a mixture of cyclododeca-\nnone and cyclododecanol.7\nPhysical and Chemical Properties. Table 2 lists the physical and\nchemical properties of the dicarboxylic acids and salts. Figure 2\npresents the relationship between molecular weight of these\ningredients and the octanol/water partition coefficient\nexpressed as log K ow.\nThe alkyl dicarboxylic acids vary considerably in their phys-\nical properties. The shorter chain (malonic, succinic, and glutaric)\nmembers are crystalline solids, very water soluble, and have lim-\nited solubility in organic solvents. As the chain length increases\nthrough adipic to dodecanedioic, water solubility decreases\nsharply (although still soluble in hot water). In other words, the\nwater solubility of these acids is inversely proportional to their\nchain length. There is a marked alternation in melting point with\nchanges in carbon number from even to odd.7Odd members (eg,\nmalonic acid and glutaric acid) exhibit lower melting points and\nhigher solubility than even carbon number alkyl dicarboxylic\nacids (eg, succinic acid and adipic acid).

Dicarboxylic acids also react with\nalcohols to give mono- and di-esters, such as those in this report.\nAnalytical Methods\nSuccinic acid. Methods used to analyze succinic acid include\nacidimetric titration for acidity; comparison with platinum–\ncobalt (Pt-Co) standard calibrated solutions for color; oxidation\nwith potassium permanganate for detection of unsaturated com-\npounds; atomic absorption or plasma spectroscopy for metals;\nand titration with silver nitrate or barium chloride for chloride or\nsulfate detection, respectively.7Small concentrations of succinic\nacid can be detected by common instrumentation such as gas–\nliquid chromatography (GLC) and polarography.\nAdipic acid. Adipic acid can be extracted from a water sample\nand analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.17\nSebacic acid.

Diisopropyl adipate\nand diethylhexyl adipate can be identified through standardinfrared (IR) spectroscopy . Gas–liquid chromatography,\nliquid–liquid extraction, mass spectrometry, and high-\npressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) are also methods of\nanalysis for the adipates.2\nUltraviolet Absorption. The dicarboxylic acids and their salts\nincluded in this review would not be expected to have any mean-\ningful ultraviolet (UV) absorption. Except for the acid functional\ngroup, these ingredients do not possess any conjugated pbonds or\nnonbonding electrons. The pbonds and nonbonding electrons in\nthe acid functional group are not part of any conjugated systems.\nAccordingly, these ingredients are unlikely to absorb light within\nthe UVA-UVB spectrum at a detectable molar absorptivity.\nUse\nCosmetic\nThe ingredients included in this safety assessment have a vari-\nety of functions in cosmetics.19The majority of the dicar-\nboxylic acids function in co smetics as pH adjusters or\nfragrance ingredients. The functions of most of the salts are\nnot reported, but it is stated that sodium succinate functions as a\nbuffering agent or pH adjuster. The functions of all ingredients\nare listed in Table 1.\nSix of the 12 dicarboxylic acids and their salts included in\nthis safety assessment are reported to be used in cosmetic\nFigure 2.

The highest\nleave-on concentration is 0.4 %disodium succinate, with der-\nmal contact exposure.\nSome of the ingredients are applied around the eye, can\npossibly be ingested, or involve mucous membrane exposure,\nand some are used in underarm deodorants. None are reported\nto be used in baby products.\nThe dicarboxylic acids and their salts are in the European\nUnion (EU) inventory of cosmetic ingredients.24Noncosmetic\nMany of the dicarboxylic acids and their salts are used in foods\nas direct or indirect food additives. The alkyl dicarboxylic acids\nare unusually versatile because of their 2 carboxyl groups.9\nThis enables many additional types of useful reactions, partic-\nularly the manufacture of polymers (eg, nylon). The most com-\nmon uses include functions as pl asticizers, lubricants, and\nbuilding blocks in the manufacture of polyesters, polyamides,\nand other plastics. The alkyl dicarboxylic acid salts are used to\nsynthesize cyclic ketones, including commercially used macro-\ncyclic musk compounds.25\nMalonic acid. Malonic acid is a useful intermediate in the\nmanufacture of barbiturates.14\nSuccinic acid. Succinic acid is listed by the FDA as a food\nadditive that is generally recognized as safe (GRAS).26Succi-\nnic acid is also utilized in detergents, pigments, toners, cementTable 3.

Adipic acid is listed as a GRAS food additive by\nthe FDA.27Adipic acid has several industrial uses in the pro-\nduction of adhesives, plasticizers, gelatinizing agents, hydrau-\nlic fluids, lubricants, emollients, polyurethane foams, leather\ntanning, and urethane.7However, the bulk of the industrial\nproduction of adipic acid is driven by its usefulness in the\nmanufacture of nylon-6,6 (in combination with 1,6-\nhexanediamine).\nAzelaic acid. FDA has approved azelaic acid for use in treat-\ning acne and rosacea. A skin cream containing 20 %(w/w)\nazelaic acid is indicated for the topical treatment of mild-to-\nmoderate inflammatory acne vulgaris,28and a gel containing\n15%azelaic acid is approved for treating rosacea.29These\ndrugs are available by prescription only. (As a reference point,\nazelaic acid is reported to be used in cosmetics at 0.3 %in\nleave-on and 10 %in rinse-off formulations that have dermal\nexposure.23)\nAzelaic acid is used in the manufacture of plasticizers, lubri-\ncants, and greases. Azelaic acid was identified as a molecule\nthat accumulated at elevated levels in some parts of plants and\nwas shown to be able to enhance the resistance of plants to\ninfections.30\nSebacic acid. Before 1973, sebacic acid was widely used in\nthe United States, as an aromatic in food.31\nSebacic acid is used in resorbable polymer systems that\ndeliver chemotherapeutic agent s (eg, cisplatin, carboplatin)\nthat are implanted at the site of tumors to provide for sustained\nrelease of the drugs.32Sebacic acid and its derivatives have a\nvariety of industrial uses as plasticizers, lubricants, diffusion\npump oils, candles, and as intermediates in the synthesis of\npolyamides and various alkyd resins.7\nDodecanedioic acid. Dodecanedioic acid is used in the pro-\nduction of nylon (nylon-6,12), polyamides, coatings, adhe-\nsives, greases, polyesters, dyestuffs, detergents, flame\nretardants, and fragrances.33\nDiethyl malonate. Diethyl malonate finds great utility as the\nstarting material in malonic ester synthesis, a classic organic\nchemistry reaction wherein a very wide variety of esters can be\nsynthesized.25\nDiisobutyl adipate. Diisobutyl adipate is considered by FDA\nto be a Prior-Sanctioned Food Ingredients, Plasticizer (21 CFR\n§ 181.27).\nDiethylhexyl adipate. Diethylhexyl adipate is used as a plasti-\ncizer for polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastics.34\nDiethyl sebacate. Before 1973, diethyl sebacate was widely\nused in the United States, as an aromatic in food.31\nDibutyl sebacate. Dibutyl sebacate is a component of PVC.35Toxicokinetics\nDicarboxylic acids are natura l metabolic products of the\no-oxidation of monocarboxylic acids when the b-oxidation\nof free fatty acids is impaired.36Under normal physiological\nconditions, dicarboxylic acids are rapidly b-oxidized, resulting\nin very low cellular concentrations and practically nondetect-\nable concentrations in the plasma.37Medium-chain dicar-\nboxylic acids (up to 12 carbon atoms) are b-oxidized in\nmitochondria and peroxisomes. Oxidation of odd- and even-\nnumbered chains proceeds to different end points. Odd-chain\ndicarboxylic acids are b-oxidized, giving acetyl-CoA and malo-\nnic acid (C3). Oxidation can then go no further, and malonic acid\nis the starter of fatty acid synthesis. Even-chain carboxylic acids\nare completely oxidized and produce succinyl-CoA, a gluconeo-\ngenic substrate, as an intermediate metabolite. Dicarboxylic\nacids are more polar than their esters, therefore they will diffuse\nless readily through normal cell membranes.38\nMalonic Acid. Malonic acid can be activated to malonyl-CoA\nand undergoes decarboxylation to acetyl-CoA by various mam-\nmalian tissues.39\nAdipic Acid Nonhuman. Adipic acid metabolism was studied\nusing fasted male albino rats.40In 1 study, in which the rats\nwere given a single oral dose, by gavage, with 50 mg radio-\nactive adipic acid (labeled on C1 or C2), 70 %of the radio-\nactivity was exhaled as carbon dioxide in 24 hours. Adipic acid\nand the metabolites urea, glutamic acid, lactic acid, b-ketoadi-\npic acid, and citric acid were r ecovered in the uri ne. Very little\nradioactivity was found in the tissues. Fasted male rats were\nalso given a single dose of a solution containing 50 mg radio-\nactive adipic acid (labeled on C 1), by gavage, in conjunction\nwith the intraperitoneal (ip) injection of 2 mL of 0.5 mol/L\nsodium malonate. After 24 hours, both radioactive adipic acid\nand succinic acid were found in the urine, which the research-\ners stated was an indication that adipic acid underwent b\noxidation. In a study in which the rats were fed 25 mg radio-\na c t i v ea d i p i ca c i d( l a b e l e do nC 1 )a n d1 0 0m g g-phenyl- a-\naminobutyric acid, followed b y a 48-hour urine collection, it\nwas determined that acetate is a metabolite of adipic acid.\nFinally, rats were given radio active sodium bicarbonate with\nnonradioactive adipic acid. Radioactive citric acid was\nformed, which suggested that c arbon dioxide interacted with\na metabolite of adipic acid. (Details not specified.)\nTwo rats were dosed orally by gavage with 2.43 g/kg par-\ntially neutralized adipic acid for 28 days. In the urine, 67 %of\nthe dose was recovered unchanged. There was no change in\nexcretion pattern over time during the study.\nRabbits were dosed orally by gavage (n ¼4) or by intrave-\nnous (iv) administration (n ¼2) with 2.43 g/kg partially neu-\ntralized adipic acid for 2 days. Following oral administration,\n53%to 61%of the dose was recovered unchanged in the urine.\nWith iv administration, 59 %to 71%was recovered unchanged\nin the urine. In another study using rabbits, animals were given\na subcutaneous (sc) dose of 2000 mg adipic acid; 3 rabbits wereBergfeld et al 15Sgiven a single dose, 1 was dosed on days 1 and 5, and 1 was\ndosed on days 1, 5, 9, 13, and 15. On average, 61 %of the dose\nwas recovered unchanged in the urine. There was an increase in\nurinary oxalic acid concentrations.\nA female dog was fed either 150 mg/kg body weight (bw)\nadipic acid (in 2 feedings) for 5 days or 750 mg/kg bw (in 2\nfeedings) for 7 days. In the urine, 18 %and 63.6 %of the low\nand high doses, respectively, were recovered unchanged.\nRabbits (number not stated) were given up to 4 sc injections\nof/C202000 mg sodium adipate.41An average of 61 %of the dose\nwas recovered unchanged in the urine. Oxalic acid was\nincreased in the urine.\nHuman. In a study in which 1 participant was given 33 mg/\nkg bw sodium adipate, orally, for 5 days (10 g total), 6.76 %of\nthe dose was recovered in the urine. In another study in which 1\nperson was given 100 mg/kg bw adipic acid for 10 days (70 g\ntotal), 61 %of the dose was recovered in the urine. Adminis-\ntration of 19.0 g adipic acid over 5 days or 23.4 g over 6 or 9\ndays (1 participant per dose) resulted in 53 %of the adminis-\ntered dose recovered in the urine.\nC9 to C12 Dicarboxylic Acids Nonhuman. Groups of 30 male\nWistar rats were dosed orally, by gavage, with azelaic (C9),\nsebacic (C10), undecanedioic (C11), or dodecanedioic (C12)\nacid.42Ten rats in each group were dosed with 20, 50, or 100\nmg of the respective acid. Blood, urine, and feces from the\ntreated rats were analyzed and compared to the blank control\nobtained from untreated rats. (None of the C9-C12 acids were\nfound in the blank controls.) In urine, approximately 2.5 %of\nazelaic, 2.1 %of sebacic, 1.8 %of undecanedioic, and 1.6 %of\ndodecanedioic acid was recovered after 5 days; the amount\nrecovered was not affected by dosage. The dicarboxylic acids\nwere not excreted in conjugated form. None of the C9-C12\ndicarboxylic acids were recovered in the feces. In the plasma,\ndicarboxylic acid catabolites that were 2-, 4-, or 6-carbons\nshorter than the corresponding dicarboxylic acid were detected.\nHuman. Groups of 3 male and 2 female participants were\nalso dosed with azelaic, sebacic, undecanedioic, or dodecane-\ndioic acid orally, in gelatin capsules, once a week for 5\nweeks.42The dose administered increased each week, from\n0.5 g at week 1 to 5.0 g at week 5. None of the C9-C12 acids\nwere found in the blank control samples of blood, urine, and\nfeces obtained from nontreated humans. In urine, approxi-\nmately 60 %of azelaic, 17 %of sebacic, 5 %of undecanedioic,\nand 0.1%of dodecanedioic acid were recovered after 12 hours;\nthe amount recovered was not affected by dosage. At 24 hours,\nthe amounts recovered were not much increased. Initially,\nundecanedioic and dodecanedioic acid administration raised\nthe urinary pH to a value of 7.4 to 8.5; the pH returned to\nnormal within 3 to 6 hours. The dicarboxylic acids were not\nexcreted in conjugated form. None of the C9-C12 dicarboxylic\nacids were recovered in the feces. In the plasma, dicarboxylic\nacid catabolites that were 2, 4, or 6 carbons shorter than the\ncorresponding dicarboxylic acid were detected. Plasma levelsof azelaic acid peaked at 2 hours, while the levels of the other 3\nacids peaked at 3 hours. Recovery in the plasma was greatest\nfor azelaic acid, 74.6 mg/mL with the 5 g dose, and the amount\ndetected decreased with increasing chain length.\nAzelaic Acid. Azelaic acid is a dietary constituent found in\nwhole grain cereals and animal products.43It can be formed\nendogenously from longer chain dicarboxylic acids, metabo-\nlism of oleic acid, and C-oxidation of monocarboxylic acids.44\nEndogenous plasma concentration and daily urinary excretion\nof azelaic acid are highly dependent on dietary intake. Azelaic\nacid crosses the blood–brain barrier.45\nA group of 25 male Wistar rats were dosed orally, by\ngavage, with 100 mCi of [1,9-14C]azelaic acid, and the animals\nwere killed at various intervals 1 to 96 hours after dosing.42\nAfter 12 and 48 hours, 13 %and 14.5 %of the radioactivity was\nfound in expired carbon dioxide, respectively. Approximately\n40%of the radioactivity was recovered in the urine over 5 days.\nThe C7 and C5 dicarboxylic acid metabolites were found in the\nurine up to 72 hours after dosing. Very little was recovered in\nthe feces. Labeled dicarboxylic acids were present in the blood\nfor up to 72 hours and consisted mainly of dicarboxylic acid\nmetabolites. Radioactivity was found in all tissues, with the\nhighest levels present in the liver, lungs, and kidneys after 12\nhours. Tissue radioactivity levels then decreased slowly in all\norgans except adipose tissue, in which case increasing levels\nwere still seen at 96 hours. Approximately 90 %of the radio-\nactivity found in the tissues was present in the lipids, and it was\nessentially localized in the fatty acid portion of the triglycerides\nand of the phospholipids. Traces of C9, C5, and C7 dicar-\nboxylic acids were detected in the first 24 hours.\nSebacic Acid. Sebacic acid is oxidized to water and carbon\ndioxide, passing through acetyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA\nformation.46\nDisodium Sebacate Nonhuman. Disodium sebacate, 80 and\n160 mg with 25 mCi of (1,10) [14C]sebacic acid tracer, was\nadministered by a single iv injection to 14 male Wistar rats,\nand blood samples were obtained at various intervals 5 to 320\nminutes after dosing.46The plasma half-life of radioactive dis-\nodium sebacate was 37.86 and 39.82 minutes for the 80 and 160\nmg dose groups, respectively. The apparent volume of distri-\nbution was 2.65 mL/100 g body wt.\nIn a second experiment, a group of 4 male Wistar rats were\ngiven a single-dose 160 mg disodium sebacate with 25 mCi\nsebacic acid tracer by iv injection, and expired carbon dioxide,\nurine, and feces were collected. The carbon dioxide half-life for\nradioactive sebacate was 93.64 minutes; 25 %of the adminis-\ntered dose was expired in carbon dioxide. A total of 34.6 %of\nsebacate was recovered in the urine in 24 hours, while 5.08 %\nsuberic acid (C8) was recovered in the same time frame. Most\nof the excretion occurred in the first 4 hours. Radioactivity was\nnot found in the feces.\nIn the third experiment, groups of 10 male Wistar rats were\nalso given 160 mg disodium sebacate with 25 mCi sebacic acid16S International Journal of Toxicology 31(Supplement 1)tracer by iv injection, and the animals were sacrificed at various\nintervals from 30 to 360 minutes after dosing. The amount of\nradioactivity in various organs was analyzed. No appreciable\nradioactivity was found in the body. Sebacate appeared to be in\nan absorption phase in fat 1 hour after dosing, but no radio-\nactivity was found in the body after 24 hours.\nThe pharmacokinetics of disodium sebacate was studied in\nmale and female Wistar rats.47Sebacate was administered\neither ip, 6 doses of 10 to 320 mg, or orally, 2 doses of 80 or\n60 mg. Plasma concentrations of sebacate and urinary concen-\ntrations of sebacate and its products of b-oxidation (suberic and\nadipic acids) were measured using GLC/mass spectrometry.\nBoth renal and nonrenal elimination parameters were obtained.\nThe sebacate half-life was 31.5 minutes. The tissue elimination\nrate was 0.0122/min, and the overall volume of distribution was\n26.817 mL/100 g. The renal clearance was 0.291 mL/min per\n100 g, which was much less than the value of the glomerular\nfiltration rate (GFR) of approximately 1 mL/min/100 g\nreported elsewhere, suggesting the presence of sebacate\nreabsorption from the ultrafiltr ate. Sebacate renal clearance\nwas found to be a concentration-independent function, sug-\ngesting the presence of a passive back diffusion. The rela-\ntive bioavailability of the oral route compared to the ip\nroute was 69.09 %, showing an extensive absorption of the\ncompound.\nHuman. The metabolism and excretion of disodium sebacate\nwas studied in 7 fasting male participants that were given a\ncontinuous steady infusion of 20 g unlabeled disodium seba-\ncate over 480 minutes.48At 240 minutes into the infusion,\n(1,10)[C14]sebacic acid was infused simultaneously as a tracer\n(sp act 0.416 mCi/min). The was a gradual increase in the\namount of radioactivity expired in carbon dioxide for the first\n300 minutes; the value remained elevated for an additional 120\nminutes before declining. At 24 hours, 11.38 mmol sebacate\nwas recovered in the urine, as well as 2.04 mmol suberic acid\nand 1.11 mmol adipic acid, which was less than 15 %of the\ndose administered. The serum concentration of unlabeled seba-\ncate reached a plateau after 270 minutes of infusion. In all, 10 %\nto 15%of serum radioactivity was found in the aqueous frac-\ntion of serum extracts. The renal clearance rate was 5.67 mL/\nmin. The overall tissue uptake of unlabeled sebacate was 180\nmmol/min, and the apparent distribution volume was 12.46 L.\nThe percentage oxidation of sebacate was 6.14 %.\nThe pharmacokinetic profile of disodium sebacate during a\nshort-time infusion (5 hours at 10 g/h) was also studied in 7\nmale participants.49Sebacate in serum and urine was measured\nby HPLC. The apparent volume of distribution of sebacate was\n8.39 L, and the plasma fractional removal rate constant was\n0.0086/min.\nSix male participants were given a single iv bolus of 1 g\ndisodium sebacate, while another 6 received 10 g of sebacate in\n500 mL of distilled water, iv, at a rate of 3.33 g/h over 3\nhours.50For the group given a bolus dose, the distribution\nphase had a short half-life, 0.34 hours, and a rapid elimination,\n2.045/h. For the group given the 3 hours infusion, 12 %of thedose was excreted as sebacic acid in 24 hours; suberic acid (C8)\nand adipic acid were also present in the urine.\nDodecanedioic Acid. A group of 25 male Wistar rats were\ndosed orally, by gavage, with 100 mCi of [10,11-3H]dodecane-\ndioic acid, and the animals were killed at various intervals 1 to\n96 hours after dosing.42Approximately 50 %of the radioactiv-\nity was recovered in the urine over 5 days. The C10, C8, and C6\ndicarboxylic acid metabolites were found up to 72 hours after\ndosing. Only 2 %of the radioactivity was recovered in the\nfeces. Labeled dicarboxylic acids were present in the blood for\nup to 72 hours and consisted mainly of dicarboxylic acid meta-\nbolites. Radioactivity was found in all tissues, with the highest\nlevels present in the liver, lungs, and kidneys after 24 hours.\nTissue radioactivity levels then decreased slowly in all organs\nexcept adipose tissue, in which case an increase in radioactivity\nwas still seen at 96 hours. Radioactivity levels were 20 %to\n40%lower in the lipid extracts of the tissues than in the residual\nmatter.3H was distributed in the whole molecule, not only the\nfatty acid portion, of the phospholipid and triglyceride frac-\ntions. Traces of C12, C10, C8, and C6 dicarboxylic acids were\ndetected in the first 24 hours.\nMale Wistar rats were given an iv bolus of 800 mmol/kg\ndisodium dodecanedioic acid.51The apparent volume of distri-\nbution was 0.248 L/kg, and the plasma half-life was 12.47\nminutes. The renal clearance was 0.00051 L/kg/min, while\nsystemic clearance was 0.0138 L/kg/min. Only 3 %to 5%of\nthe dose was recovered in the urine.\nPercutaneous Absorption\nAzelaic acid. The in vitro percutaneous absorption of a 15 %\nazelaic acid gel through human skin, prior to or after the appli-\ncation of 3 different moisturiz er formulations, was deter-\nmined.52All doses were applied as 5 mL/cm2. The second\ndose was applied 15 minutes after the first. [14C]Azelaic acid\nhad a finite dose absorption profile, with a rise to peak pene-\ntration followed by a slow but steady decline. In vitro, 70 %of\nthe azelaic acid diffused into the reservoir solution over 48\nhours. The application of a moisturizer, and whether it was\napplied prior to or following azelaic acid administration, did\nnot have a statistically significant effect on the penetration of\nazelaic acid. However, there was a trend toward greater percu-\ntaneous penetration and mass distribution with the application\nof a moisturizer lotion prior to the azelaic acid gel.\nThe percutaneous absorption of azelaic acid was determined\nusing 6 male participants. A total of 5 g of a cream containing\n20%azelaic acid was applied to the face (1 g), chest (2 g), and\nupper back (2 g) of each participant, giving an area dose of\napproximate 5 mg cream/cm2skin. The test areas were covered\n1 hour after dosing with cotton tissues and washed 24 hours\nafter dosing. After 1 week, 100 mL of an aqueous microcrystal-\nline suspension containing 1 g azelaic acid was given orally to\neach participant. Urinary excretion of unchanged azelaic acid\nwas measured after each dose. Following dermal application,\n1.29%of the dose was recovered unchanged in the urine in 24Bergfeld et al 17Shours, and a total of 2.2 %was recovered by day 3. Following\noral administration, 61.2 %of the dose was recovered within 4\nhours; excretion was complete at this point. Assuming similar\nrates and pathways in biotransformation following both routes\nof exposure, percutaneous absorption of azelaic acid was deter-\nmined to be 3.6 %of the dermally applied dose.53\nToxicological Studies\nSingle Dose (Acute) Toxicity\nThe acute oral, dermal, inhalation, and parenteral toxicity of\nthe dicarboxylic acids and some of the salts are summarized in\nTable 4.40,54-59The oral LD 50values of the dicarboxylic acids\nhad a wide range, for example, adipic acid had values for rats\nranging from 940 mg/kg to greater than the highest dose tested\n(11 000 mg/kg). Most reported values for the acids were >200\nmg/kg. The reported dermal LD 50values ranged from >6000\nmg/kg dodecanedioic acid to >10 000 mg/kg glutaric acid.\nRepeat Dose Toxicity\nCellular effects. Dicarboxylic acids have a cytotoxic effect on the\nabnormally hyperactive and malignant epidermal melanocytes.\nDicarboxylic acids, C8 to C13, have been shown to inhibit\nmitochondrial oxidoreductases,62and they have been shown\nto reversibly inhibit microsomal NADPH and cytochrome\nP450 reductase.63Medium chain length dicarboxylic acids are\nalso competitive inhibitors of tyrosinase in vitro.\nAdipic acid. The effect of adipic acid on primary keratinocyte\ncultures was evaluated using epidermal cells from neonatal\nNMRI mice.64Concentrations of /C2030 mmol/L did not inhibit\n3H-thymidine incorporation or affect DNA synthesis, while 40\nand 50 mmol/L inhibited both of these parameters. No effect on\nlabeling indices was observed with 1 to 30 mmol/L adipic acid.\nAzelaic acid. Azelaic acid, a naturally occurring competitive\ninhibitor of tyrosinase, has a cytotoxic effect on malignant\nmelanocytes.65Azelaic acid is also a competitive inhibitor of\na number of oxidoreductive enzymes, enzymes involved in\nDNA synthesis, and of oxidoreductases of the respiratory\nchain.66It has been reported that, in vitro, azelaic acid has time-\nand dose-dependent, reversible, and antiproliferative and cyto-\ntoxic effects on a number of tumoral cell lines. Azelaic acid had\nno effect on normal cell lines.\nDisodium azelate. Disodium azelate inhibited cell prolifera-\ntion and affected viability of Cloudman and Harding-Passey\nmurine melanomata at concentrations /C2110/C02mol/L when incu-\nbated over a 3-day period.62The mitochondria were the prime\ntarget of action.\nThe effect of disodium azelate on primary keratinocyte cul-\ntures was evaluated using epidermal cells from neonatal NMRI\nmice.64A dose-dependent inhibition of3H-thymidine incor-\nporation into DNA, ranging from 50 %inhibition with 20\nmmol/L to 90 %inhibition with 50 mmol/L disodium azelate,was observed following a 12-hour incubation period. Concen-\ntrations of 1 and 10 mmol/L did not affect DNA synthesis, but a\nmarked reduction was seen with 20 to 50 mmol/L. The effects\non DNA synthesis were time dependent, with the maximum\ninhibitory effect observed at 4 hours; this effect was reversible.\nRNA and protein synthesis were also inhibited during the first 4\nhours of incubation with 50 mmol/L disodium azelate. Cellular\nstructure was altered upon incubation with disodium azelate,\nprimarily affecting mitochondria and the rough endoplasmic\nreticulum. These effects were also reversible.\nDodecanedioic acid. The disodium salt of dodecanedioic acid\ninhibited cell proliferation and affected viability of Cloudman\nand Harding-Passey murine m elanomata at concentrations\n/C2110/C02mol/L, when incubated over a 3-day period.62The mito-\nchondria were the prime target of action.\nAnimal studies. Most of the available animal studies were oral\nexposures, although limited inhalation studies were available\nfor adipic acid.\nAdipic acid Oral. Groups of 6 male Sprague-Dawley rats were\ndosed orally (method not specified) with 3600 to 5600 mg/kg bw\nadipic acid as an 18.6 %to 24.9%solution in saline for 14 days.40\nThree animals of the 3600 mg/kg bw group, 5 of the 4000 mg/kg\nbw group, and all of the 4500 to 5600 mg/kg bw groups died\nprior to study termination. Signs of toxicity included depressed\nactivity, labored respiration, ataxia, and convulsions. No gross\nfindings were noted at necropsy at study termination.\nGroups of 5 rats were dosed with 0 or 3000 mg/kg bw of a\nneutralized 20 %adipic acid solution orally, by gavage, for 4\nweeks.49A nonsignificant decrease in bw gain was observed. In\na 4-week study in which a group of 3 rats was dosed orally, by\ngavage, with 2400 mg/kg bw adipic acid, no significant tox-\nicological effects were noted.\nIn a 4-week dietary study in which groups of 17 to 20 female\nrats were fed 0 to 40 mg/d (0-435 mg/kg bw per d) adipic acid,\nno effects were reported.49The no-observable adverse effect\nlevel (NOAEL) was >435 mg/kg bw per d. In a 5-week dietary\nstudy in which groups of 15 to 18 male rats were fed 0 to 800\nmg/d (0-13 333 mg/kg bw/d) decreased bw gains, an unkempt\nappearance, and diarrhea were observed for the animals fed 800\nmg/d the first 3 weeks. In another 5-week dietary study in\nwhich groups of 4 rats, gender not specified, were fed 100 or\n200 mg/d (310-922 mg/kg bw/d) of a 20 %adipic acid solution\nin ethanol, 5 days/week, no signs of toxicity were observed.\nTen rats were dosed orally, method not specified, with 199\nmg/d (638-1332 mg/kg bw/d) sodium adipate, 5 days/week for\n9 weeks.49No toxicological effects were observed.\nA group of 5 guinea pigs, gender not specified, were dosed\norally using capsules with 400 mg/d (682-942 mg/kg bw/d)\nadipic acid for 5 days, followed by dosing with 600 mg/d\n(1032-1739 mg/kg bw/d), 5 days/week for 5 weeks.49No signs\nof toxicity were observed.\nNo toxicity was observed in a study in which pigs were fed\n1%adipic acid in the diet for 7 days.4918S International Journal of Toxicology 31(Supplement 1)Table 4.

Groups of 10 male and 10 female Wistar\nrats were fed a diet containing 0, 500, or 1000 mg/kg bw dis-\nodium sebacate for 6 mos, after which time they were killed\nand necropsied.54Growth was similar between test and control\ngroups, as were the microscopic examinations and clinical\nchemistry parameters. The researchers found similar, negative,results when groups of 10 male and 10 female New Zealand\nrabbits were fed diets containing 0, 750, or 1000 mg/kg bw\ndisodium sebacate for 6 mos.\nOcular Irritation\nOcular irritation studies are summarized in Table 5.\nSuccinic acid. The ocular irritation potential of succinic acid\nwas evaluated using albino rabbits.55Undiluted test material,\n0.005 mL, was applied to the center of the cornea. The eyes\nwere not rinsed. Succinic acid was a severe eye irritant, with\nnecrosis visible upon staining. The score for ocular irritation,\non a scale of 1 to 10, was 8.\nGlutaric acid. A Draize ocular irritation study was performed\nin which 100 mg of glutaric acid was instilled in the eyes of 3\nrabbits and the eyes were rinsed 24 hours after application.55\nGlutaric acid was irritating to rabbit eyes, with a primary irrita-\ntion index (PII) of 35.2/110. Mild erythema, slight edema, and\nslight dullness were still present after 7 days.\nAdipic acid. The ocular irritation of adipic acid was evaluated\nusing groups of 2 albino rabbits.55Ten or 57.1 mg of adipic\nacid was placed in the eye of each rabbit, and the eye of 1\nanimal in each group was rinsed. With 10 mg followed by\nrinsing, mild conjunctival irritation was observed; and the eye\nwas normal within 3 days. In the unrinsed eye, mild conjuncti-\nval irritation and a minimal iritic effect were observed; minimal\nconjunctival irritation was still observed after 7 days and the\neye was normal after 14 days. With instillation of 57.1 mg\nadipic acid followed by rinsing, moderate to mild conjunctival\nirritation and transient mild opacity were observed; the eye was\nnormal in 3 days. In the unrinsed eye, moderate to mild con-\njunctival irritation, mild opacity of the cornea, and a minimal\niritic effect were observed; the eye was normal at day 7. How-\never, other studies have reported that adipic acid produced\nsevere irritation in rabbit eyes, and the signs of irritation were\nstill present after 8 days.40\nAdipic/glutaric/succinic acid mixture. The ocular irritation\npotential of a mixture of adipic, glutaric, and succinic acid,\npercentages not specified, was evaluated using 2 male albino\nrabbits.55One-tenth milliliter of the test substance was instilled\nin the conjunctival sac of each animal, and the eye of 1 animal,\nbut not the other, was rinsed. The contralateral eye served as\nthe negative control. Mild to severe conjunctivitis was\nobserved in on both the rinsed and unrinsed rabbit eyes. Both\neyes were normal within 21 days.\nDodecanedioic acid. In studies using rabbits that evaluated the\nocular irritation of dodecanedioic acid, slight irritation was\nreported in 1 study, with a PII of 11.96/110, and small areas\nof corneal opacity and mild conjunctival irritation were seen in\nthe other study.56Details were not provided.Bergfeld et al 21SDermal Irritation/Sensitization\nMost of the available dermal irritation and sensitization data\nregarding alkyl dicarboxylic acids and their salts were from\nanimal studies. These animal data are summarized in Table 6.\nHuman data were available for adipic and azelaic acids only.\nSuccinic acid. Succinic acid was a slight irritant to rabbit\nskin.55Details were not provided.\nGlutaric acid. The dermal irritation potential of glutaric acid\nwas determined using 2 male and 4 female New Zealand white\nrabbits.53A 0.5 g aliquot of glutaric acid was applied to the\nclipped skin on the back of the rabbits. The test site was scored\nfor irritation after 3 minutes, and the site was then washed. The\ntest material was then applied to 2 other test sites, which were\ncovered with a rubber wrap. The sites were examined at 1 hour\nand 4 hours, and the site was washed after both examinations.\nThe sites were then evaluated at 24 and 48 hours after appli-\ncation. Slight erythema was seen in 1 rabbit throughout the\nstudy. Irritation was not observed in the other rabbits.Adipic Acid Nonhuman. A dermal irritation study was per-\nformed in which 500 mg of 50 %aqueous adipic acid was\napplied under an occlusive patch to a 5 cm x 5 cm area of intact\nand abraded skin of 6 rabbits for 24 hours.38With intact skin,\nan erythema score of 2 to 3/4 was reported, with clearing by\nday 3. With abraded skin, mild to severe erythema and edema\nwere reported, which cleared by day 7.\nAdipic acid, undiluted or as an 80 %aqueous paste, was\napplied occlusively to the backs of ears of rabbits for 24 hours.\nTwo rabbits were used per group. No irritation was observed on\nthe backs of animals. Erythema was observed on the ear, with\nclearing by 72 hours. In another study in which adipic acid was\napplied occlusively for 24 hours, irritation was not observed.\nDetails were not provided.\nA semi-occlusive application of 500 mg of a paste of\n50%adipic acid in propylene glycol to 6 rabbits produced\nslight to mild irritation in 3 of the rabbits. A semi-occlusive\napplication of undiluted adip ic acid was not corrosive. Adi-\npic acid, 50 %in propylene glycol, was not irritating to a\ngroup of 10 guinea pigs.Table 5.

The sensitization potential was also evaluated, using 4\nsacral intradermal injections of 0.1 mL of a 1 %suspension for\ninduction. After a 13-day nontreatment period, a dermal chal-\nlenge was performed with 0.05 mL of an 8 %and 80%suspen-\nsion of the mixture. Ten previously untreated guinea pigs were\nexposed to the same challenge applications as the test animals.\nIn the test for primary irritation, the 8 %suspension produced\nno irritation, and no to mild irritation was observed 24 hours\nafter exposure to the 80 %suspension. No sensitization was\nobserved at either dose.\nAzelaic acid. The cumulative irritation potential of a 15 %\nazelaic acid gel (prescription formulation; vehicle not identi-\nfied) was determined in a study using 31 female and 2 male\nparticipants.64(During the study, 1 participant withdrew for\npersonal reasons.) White petrolatum was used as a negative\ncontrol. Azelaic acid and petrolatum, 0.2 g of each, were\napplied under occlusion to 2 cm x 2 cm sites on the back of\neach participant 3 times per week for 3 weeks. Weekday\npatches were removed after 24 hours, while the patches applied\non Fridays were removed after 72 hours. The test sites were\nevaluated 15 to 30 minutes after removal of the patch, and then\na new patch was applied. Appl ication was discontinued if\nsevere irritation, which was designated by a maximum\nerythema score of 3, was observed. A 15 %azelaic acid gel was\nstatistically significantly more irritating than the negative con-\ntrol, with a mean cumulative irritancy index of 1.05/3. Individ-\nual reaction scores for the test article ranged from 0 to 3, and 5\nparticipants discontinued patching with azelaic acid due to an\nirritation score /C213. Cumulative irritancy increased with suc-\ncessive patching. The researchers noted that since the vehicle\nused for azelaic acid was not tested, there was uncertainty as to\nwhether the vehicle components affected the irritation scores.\nTwice daily application of a cream containing 20 %azelaic\nacid has been reported to cause erythema, irritation, pruritus,\ndryness, scaling, and burning.65\nDodecanedioic acid. Dodecanedioic acid was not an irritant to\nrabbit skin in a 4-hour exposure study or upon application of\n0.5 g.54In a maximization study using female guinea pigs,\n0.5%dodecanedioic acid was injected intracutaneously at\ninduction and 25 and 50 %was used for the dermal challenge.\nDodecanedioic acid was not a sensitizer.\nMucosal Irritation\nSuccinic acid. Succinic acid has been considered to be an\nexacerbating factor in ulcerative colitis, therefore its influence\non rat colonic mucosa in terms of mucosal blood flow and\nsuperoxide generation was investigated.66The left side of the\ncolon of 5 male and 5 female rats was exposed, and 0.9 %to 5%\nsuccinic acid in physiological saline was instilled into the colo-\nnic lumen. A segment of the colon was then ligated as to notinclude the mesenteric blood vessel. Mucosal blood flow\ndecreased with all dose levels. Microscopically, the higher\nthe concentration of succinic acid, the greater was the ero-\nsion formation in the colonic mucosa. Significant polymor-\nphonuclear cell infiltration superoxide generation from\ncolon tissue was observed with 0.01 %succinic acid, as\ncompared to higher or lower concentrations. Succinic acid,\nat fecal concentrations found i n active stage ulcerative coli-\ntis, appears to be implicated in mucosal injury, mediated by\na decrease in colonic mucosal b lood flow and infiltration of\nsuperoxide-generating polymorphonuclear cells into the\nmucosa.\nReproductive and Developmental Toxicity\nMalonic Acid. Malonic acid, 0.1 %, reduced the pH of sperm\nsuspensions from 7.5 to 4.5 to 5.5 and it rendered human sper-\nmatozoa immotile within 30 minutes.67A concentration of\n1.0%reduced the pH to 1.5 to 3.0 and was almost instanta-\nneously spermicidal.\nSuccinic Acid. Thirty ovariectomized female rats were given\ndaily sc injections of 5.0 mg/d succinic acid for 3 weeks.53\nTen females were used as cont rols. Daily vaginal smears\nwere similar for test and contr ol animals. Microscopically,\nno changes were seen in the uterine horn, cervix, or vagina\nof the animals.\nGlutaric Acid. The reproductive toxicity of glutaric acid was\nevaluated using groups of 25 female rats.53The animals were\ndosed orally, by gavage, with 0, 125, 400, or 1300 mg/kg\nglutaric acid on days 6 to 15 of gestation, and the animals were\nkilled on day 20 of gestation. No toxicological or reproductive\neffects were observed for the 125 mg/kg group. In the 400 mg/\nkg group, salivation, rales, and nasal discharge were observed.\nOne dam of the 1300 mg/kg group died on day 10 of gestation,\nand 1 was killed due to moribund condition on day 13 of\ngestation. Mean bw gains were decreased in the 1300 mg/kg\ngroup during dosing, but bw gains in this group were normal\npost-dosing. Clinical signs of toxicity in the 1300 mg/kg group\nincluded salivation, rales, nasal discharge, and staining around\nthe mouth, nares, and anogenital area. No adverse effects on\npregnancy and no teratogenic effects were reported at any of\nthe dose levels. There was a significant increase in resorptions\nin the 1300 mg/kg group compared to controls, but the value\nwas within normal expected limits and, therefore, not consid-\nered biologically meaningful.\nGroups of 18 gravid female New Zealand white rabbits were\ndosed orally, by gavage, on days 6 to 18 of gestation with 0, 50,\n160, or 500 mg/kg glutaric acid, and the animals were killed on\nday 29 of gestation.53No test-article related mortality occurred.\nThere were no clinical signs of toxicity, and bws were not\naffected. No embryotoxic, teratogenic, or adverse reproductive\neffects were reported.\nAdipic Acid. Groups of 20 to 24 gravid albino CD-1 mice were\ndosed orally, by gavage, with 0, 2.6, 12, 56, or 263 mg/kg bw24S International Journal of Toxicology 31(Supplement 1)adipic acid on days 6 to 15 of gestation.38All animals were\nkilled on day 17 of gestation. No reproductive, developmental,\nor maternal effects were observed, and the NOAEL for mater-\nnal and developmental toxicity was 263 mg/kg bw. Similar\nresults were obtained in a study in which gravid Wistar rats\nwere dosed orally, by gavage, with 0, 2.9, 13, 62, or 288 mg/kg\nbw adipic acid on days 6 to 15 of gestation. The NOAEL for\nmaternal and developmental toxicity was 288 mg/kg bw.38\nGroups of 21 to 24 gravid hamsters were dosed orally, by\ngavage, with 0, 2.9, 5, 44, or 205 mg/kg bw adipic acid on days\n6 to 10 of gestation. A significant increase in resorption per\nimplant site was observed with 205 mg/kg bw adipic acid,\nresulting in a decreased number of live fetuses. (This decrease\nwas not evaluated statistically.) No other effects were\nreported.38\nGroups of 10 to 14 gravid Dutch-belted rabbits were dosed\nby oral intubation with 0, 2.5, 12, 54, or 250 mg/kg bw adipic\nacid on days 6 to 18 of gestation. No reproductive, develop-\nmental, or maternal effects were observed. The NOAEL for\nmaternal toxicity was /C21250 mg/kg bw and for developmental\ntoxicity was 250 mg/kg bw.38\nAzelaic Acid. Reproductive and teratogenic effects of azelaic\nacid were evaluated using Wistar rats and New Zealand rab-\nbits.57A group of 20 gravid rats was fed a diet containing 140\nmg/kg bw/d azelaic acid, and a control group of 10 gravid rats\nwas given untreated feed. Half of each group was killed and\nnecropsied on day 19 of gestation, and the remaining animals\ncontinued dosing for 3 mos. The day of gestation that dosing\nstarted is not clear. No gross or microscopic lesions were\nobserved for the uteri, placentas, or ovaries. There were no\ndifferences in reproductive, teratogenic, or developmental\neffects between treated and control groups, nor were there any\ndifferences in fetal weights of the live fetuses. Similar results\nwere seen using groups of 20 gravid rabbits fed 200 mg/kg bw/\nd azelaic acid; 10 untreated gravid rabbits were used as a neg-\native control group.\nEmbryotoxic effects were observed in oral studies with rats\nreceiving 2500 mg/kg bw/d of azelaic acid.42Similar effects\nwere observed in studies in rabbits given 150 to 500 mg/kg bw/\nd and in monkeys given 500 mg/kg bw/d. The doses at which\nthese effects were noted were all within toxic dose ranges for\nthe dams. No teratogenic effects were observed. (Details were\nnot provided.)\nDisodium Sebacate. Reproductive, teratogenic, and develop-\nmental effects of disodium sebacate were evaluated using Wis-\ntar rats and New Zealand rabbits.57Groups of 20 gravid rats\nwere fed a diet containing 0 or 500 mg/kg bw/d disodium\nsebacate, and groups of 20 gravid rabbits were fed 0 or 1000\nmg/kg bw. Half of each group was killed and necropsied on day\n19 of gestation, and the remaining animals continued dosing for\n3 mos. The day of gestation that dosing started is not clear. No\ngross or microscopic lesions were observed for the uteri, pla-\ncentas, or ovaries. There were no differences in reproductive ordevelopmental effects between treated and control groups, nor\nwere there any differences in fetal weights of the live fetuses.\nDodecanedioic Acid. The reproductive toxicity of 0 to 1000\nmg/kg bw dodecanedioic acid was evaluated in an OECD com-\nbined repeated doe and reproductive/developmental toxicity\nscreening test using male and female Crl:CD:BR rats.54The\nno-observable effect level (NOEL) for reproductive and devel-\nopmental toxicity was 1000 mg/kg bw.\nSodium Salt of Adipic, Azelaic, Sebacic, and Dodecanedioic Acids.\nThe influence of the sodium salt of some dicarboxylic acids\n(adipic acid, azelaic acid, sebacic acid, dodecanedioic acid) on\nboth spontaneous and evoked muscle activity of the uterine\nhorns of 35 female Wistar rats (250-300 g) has been studied\nin vitro.68Spontaneous activity of uterine muscle was inhibited\nby dicarboxylic salts causing the total abolition of mechanical\nevents at concentrations of 24, 32, 40, and 64 /C210/C03mol/L.\nDicarboxylic salts antagonized the maximal isometric contrac-\ntion of the uterine horn induced by administration of acetylcho-\nline, oxytocin or prostaglandins (PGF 2-a). The amount of\nantagonism was dependent upon the concentration of dicar-\nboxylic salt used. Dicarboxylic salts had an specific inhibitory\neffect on the uterine horn which progressively increased with\ntheir chain length. The results suggested that the inhibitory\neffects of dicarboxylic salts on smooth muscle could be due\nto a cellular membrane hyperpolarization.\nGenotoxicity\nAvailable genotoxicity studies are summarized in Table 7.\nIn Vitro\nMalonic acid. Malonic acid, 3333 mg/plate, was not muta-\ngenic in a National Toxicology Program (NTP) preincubation\nassay, with or without metabolic activation.70\nSuccinic acid. The genotoxic potential of succinic acid was\nevaluated in an Ames test and in a chromosomal aberration\nstudy using a Chinese hamster fibroblast cell line.71Succinic\nacid, at a concentration of /C205.0 mg/plate in phosphate buffer,\nwas not mutagenic in the Ames test. (Whether metabolic activa-\ntion was used is not stated.) Concentrations of /C201.0 mg/mL in\nsaline were not genotoxic in the chromosomal aberration assay.\nDisodium succinate. The genotoxic potential of disodium suc-\ncinate was evaluated in an Ames test and in a chromosomal\naberration study using a Chinese hamster fibroblast cell line.71\nIn the Ames test, disodium succinate was not mutagenic at\nconcentration up to 5.0 mg/plate in phosphate buffer.

Groups of 50 male and 50 female F344 rats\nwere given drinking water containing 0, 1, or 2 %sodium suc-\ncinate for 2 years, and the carcinogenic potential was deter-\nmined.58Dosing was discontinued after 104 weeks, and, after a\n9-week recovery period, the rats were killed. Body weights of\nthe high-dose animals were decreased by 10 %as compared tocontrols. There were no statistically significant differences in\noverall tumor incidence or mean survival time between treated\nand control animals. An increase in the incidence of C-cell\nadenoma/carcinoma of the thyroid in females of the 2 %group,\nand a positive trend in the occurrence of this tumor, was con-\nsidered a function of experimental variability and not related to\ndosing. Sodium succinate was not toxic or carcinogenic to male\nor female F344 rats when given in the drinking water for 2\nyears.\nAdipic Acid. Adipic acid was not carcinogenic in the 2-year\nchronic oral toxicity study (described previously) in which\ngroups of 20 male rats were fed diets containing 0 %,0 . 1%,\n1%,3%, and 5%adipic acid, and groups of 10 and 19 females\nwere fed 0 %and 1%adipic acid, respectively.57\nTumor Promotion\nSuccinic acid, sodium succinate, disodium succinate. The promo-\ntion of urinary bladder carcinogenesis by sodium succinate was\nevaluated using male F344 rats.79Groups of 16 male F344 rats\nwere given 5 %succinic acid, sodium succinate, or disodium\nsuccinate with 0.05 %N-butyl- N- (4-hydroxybutyl)nitrosamine\n(BBN) in the drinking water for 4 weeks, followed by dietary\nadministration of 5 %of the respective test article without BBN\nfor 32 weeks. Negative controls were given water with BBN\nonly and untreated feed. Groups of 8 male F344 rats followed\nthe same protocol without the addition of BBN to the drinking\nwater, as did a group of non-BBN-treated negative controls.\nThe animals were killed at week 37.\nIn the BBN-pretreated groups, many rats given sodium or\ndisodium succinate developed hematuria towards the end of the\nstudy. There were no statistica lly significant d ifferences in\nbody or organ weights between the control and test groups.\n(Information on organ and bws was not provided for the non-\nBBN groups.) Large tumors were found on the urinary bladders\nof the BBN-pretreated animals given sodium and disodium\nsuccinate; tiny lesions were found in the control or succinic\nacid BBN-pretreated animals. The incidence and number of\nurinary bladder carcinomas and papillomas and of papillary\nor nodular hyperplasia (preneoplastic lesions) were statistically\nsignificantly increased in the sodium and disodium succinate\nBBN-pretreated groups as compared to the succinic acid and\ncontrol BBN-pretreated groups. The incidence and numbers\nobserved in the sodium and disodium succinate groups were\nnot statistically significantly different from each other. An\nassociation between tumor area and sodium intake was noted.\nUrinary bladder lesions were not observed in any of the animals\nthat were not pretreated with BBN. Urinary pH and electrolyte\nconcentrations were affected by dosing with sodium or diso-\ndium succinate with BBN, as compared to the control and\nsuccinic acid groups, and statistically significant differences\nbetween these 2 groups were observed as well.\nThe researchers also evaluated cell proliferation and DNA\nsynthesis in the urinary bladder epithelium. Groups of 20 male\nF344 rats were given 5 %succinic acid, sodium succinate, or28S International Journal of Toxicology 31(Supplement 1)disodium succinate in the feed, without BBN pretreatment for 8\nweeks. Negative controls were given basal diet. Five rats per\ngroup were given an ip injection of 50 mg/kg bw 5-bromo-2’-\ndeoxyuridine (BrdU) 1 hour prior to being killed. Compared to\ncontrol values, BrdU uptake was statistically significantly\nincreased by increased disodium succinate and was increased,\nbut not in a statistically significant manner, by sodium succi-\nnate. Succinic acid did not have any effect on DNA synthesis.\nMicroscopically, simple hyperplasia was observed in the urin-\nary bladders of animals given sodium and disodium succinate.\nThe appearance of the urinary bladder epithelial surface was\naltered by sodium and disodium succinate. Spermidine/spermine\nN1-acetyltransferase activity in the urinary bladder epithelium\nwas increased for disodium succinate, but not sodium succinate,\nwhen compared to controls. Urinary pH and electrolyte concen-\ntrations were affected as described previously.\nPart II: Esters of alkyl Dicarboxylic Acids\nChemistry\nMethod of Manufacture\nAlkyl dicarboxylic acids are easily esterified with the appro-\npriate alcohol, with our without acid or metal catalyst (Fischer\nesterification).9For example, diethylhexyl adipate can be\nmanufactured from adipic acid and ethylhexanol with an acid\ncatalyst (Figure 3).\nDiethyl malonate. Malonic acid esters can be produced either\nby cobalt-catalyzed a lkoxycarbonylation of chloroacetates\nwith carbon monoxide in the presence of the appropriate alco-\nhol, or by hydrolysis of cyanoacetic acid followed by esterifi-\ncation with the respective alcohol.39Diethyl malonate is\nprepared from chloroacetic acid and sodium cyanide followed\nby esterification with ethanol and sulfuric acid.80\nDiisopropyl adipate. Diisopropyl adipate is produced by ester-\nification of adipic acid with an excess of isopropanol. The\nexcess alcohol is removed by vacuum stripping and the ester\nis then alkali-refined and filtered.2\nDibutyl adipate. Adipic acid is esterified with butyl alcohol\nby a continuous distillation process.81\nDiethylhexyl adipate. Diethylhexyl adipate can be prepared by\nthe reaction of adipic acid and 2-ethylhexanol in the presenceof an esterification catalyst such as sulfuric acid or para -\ntoluenesulfonic acid (Figure 2).17Purification of the reaction\nproduct includes removal of the catalyst, alkali refining, and\nstripping.2\nAlkyl succinates. Succinic anhydride reacts readily with alco-\nhols to give monoesters of succinic acid (eg, decyl succinate\nfrom decanol), which are readily further esterified to the diesters\nby Fischer methods.7Dimethyl succinate can be produced from\nmethanol and succinic anhydride or succinic acid, or by hydro-\ngenation of dimethyl maleate. Diethyl succinate can be prepared\nby the same methods (from ethanol or diethyl maleate).\nChemical and Physical Properties\nTable 8 lists the properties of the alkyl dicarboxylic acid esters.\nFigure 4 shows the relationship between molecular weight and\nthe octanol water partitioning coefficient, expressed as log\nKow, for these ingredients.\nThe diesters, in contrast to the free acids, are much more\nlipid soluble and more difficult to dissolve in water. The\nmono-esters, by definition, are hybrids of the acids and die-\nsters, but their physical properties are much more closely\nrelated to the diesters.\nShort-chain alkyl (ie, methyl, isopropyl, and butyl) mono-\nand diesters are more soluble in water, less lipophilic, and rela-\ntively more volatile than the corresponding longer chain alkyl\n(ie, C8-C13 alcohol) esters.21Most esters with molecular\nweights greater than 340 have boiling points greater than\n300/C14C and are relatively nonvolatile and lipophilic (log K ow>7).\nImpurities\nDiethyl malonate. Diethyl malonate is a colorless organic\nliquid with an ester like odor.39The purity is typically > 99\n%. Impurities from the production process include ethanol (ca.\n0.1%w/w), ethyl acetate (ca. 0.05 %w/w), and ethyl methyl\nmalonate (ca. 0.05 %w/w).\nDibutyl adipate. Impurities are generally not found due to the\nmanufacturing process, but available data demonstrate that\narsenic levels are below a detection limit of 1 ppm, heavy\nmetals (as lead) are below a detection limit of 10 ppm, and\nsulfated ash is below a detection limit of 0.1 %.81OHOO\nOHH3C OH\nH3Cp-toluenesulfonicacid\n(catalyst)H3CS\nOOOH\nOOO\nOH3CH3C\nCH3\nCH3 DiethylhexyladipateEthylhexanolAdipicacid\nFigure 3.

Accordingly, these ingredients are unlikely to absorb\nlight within the UVA-UVB spectrum at a detectable molar\nabsorptivity.Use\nCosmetic\nThe ingredients included in this safety assessment have a vari-\nety of functions in cosmetics.19For the esters, some of the\ncommon functions include skin conditioning agents, fragrance\ningredients, plasticizers, solvents, and emollients.

Particles\nwith a d afrom 0.1 to 10 mm settle in the upper respiratory\ntract and particles with a d a<0 . 1 mm settle in the lower\nrespiratory tract.86,87\nParticle diameters of 60 to 80 mm and /C2180mm have been\nreported for anhydrous hair sprays and pump hairsprays,\nrespectively.88In practice, aerosols should have at least 99 %\nof their particle diameters in the 10 to 110 mm range and the\nmean particle diameter in a typical aerosol spray has been\nreported as *38mm.89Therefore, most aerosol particles are\ndeposited in the nasopharyngeal region and are not respirable.\nAlkyl dicarboxylic acids esters are in the European Union (EU)\ninventory of cosmetic ingredients.24\nNoncosmetic\nMany of the dicarboxylic acids esters are used in foods as direct\nor indirect food additives.9The diesters have widespread use as\nlubricants, plasticizers, and solvents.86\nToxicokinetics\nThe simple alkyl di-esters are the result of the condensation of\nalkyl dicarboxylic acids and 2 equivalents of alkyl alcohols.\nThese ingredients can be metabolized via hydrolysis back to\nthe parent alcohol, the monoester, and the parent dicarboxylic\nacid (Figure 5). Previous safety assessments conducted by the\nPanel have addressed the safety of cetyl, methyl, isostearyl,\nmyristyl, and behenyl alcohol.90,200\nMetabolism of diesters in animals is expected to occur,\ninitially, via enzymatic hydrol ysis, leading to the corre-\nsponding dicarboxylic acids and the corresponding linear\nor branched alcohol.87These dicarboxylic acids and alco-\nhols can be further metabolized or conjugated to polar prod-\nucts that are excreted in urine. However, other studies have\nshown that enzymatic hydrolysis of at least some diesters\nmay be incomplete and result, instead, in the production of\nmonoesters.91Diethyl malonate. Diethyl malonate is hydrolyzed via a 2-step\nreaction to malonic acid and the corresponding alcohol,\nethanol.39\nDimethyl malonate, which is not listed in the International\nCosmetic Ingredient Dictionary , has similar physico-chemical\nproperties and hydrolyzes in the same manner to malonic acid\nand methanol. Because of this similarity, data on dimethyl\nmalonate are included in subsequent sections of part II to pro-\nvide read-across data.\nDistribution of diethyl malonate (and dimethyl malonate) is\nlikely to occur in the water compartments, and accumulation in\nfat is unlikely based on physical and chemical properties. Both\nesters are likely to be metabolized by unspecific (serine-)\nesterases of different tissues, in particular, in the liver to the\nmono- esters and then to malonic acid and ethanol (or metha-\nnol). The hydrolysis product is likely to be metabolized via\nphysiological pathways, such as the tricarboxylic acid cycle,\nas they are part of the normal intermediate metabolism. Both\nare assumed to readily absorb via mucous membranes.\nIn Vitro—Nonhuman\nThe percutaneous absorption of radiolabeled diethyl malonate\nwas determined in vitro using skin from Yorkshire pigs.39\n[2-14C]Diethyl malonate was applied either undiluted (100\nmg/cm2) or diluted in ethanol at 12.5 mg/mL with an applied\ndose of 100 mg/cm2or as 0.5 mg/mL with an applied dose of\n4mg/cm2. At 50 hours, with undiluted diethyl malonate, 8.8 %\nof the radioactivity was found in the skin and 3 %was in the\nreceptor fluid. With 100 mg in ethanol, 13 %of the radioactivity\nwas found in the skin and 6 %in the receptor fluid and with 4 mg\nin ethanol, 30 %was found in the skin and 10 %in the receptor\nfluid. Absorption appeared to be enhanced with ethanol.\nThe percutaneous absorption of 1 mg/cm2[2-14C]diethyl\nmalonate in 10 ml acetone was determined in vitro also using\nskin from Yorkshire pigs. At 24 hours, 0.2 %to 1.6%of the\ndiethyl malonate was found in the receptor fluid, 0.2 %to 0.9%\nwas found in the skin, and 0.6 %to 0.7%was found on the skin\nsurface. Skin mediated hydrolysis amounted to 15 %to 35%of\nthe applied dose. In the receptor fluid, 20 %to 21%of the\napplied dose was present as hydrolysis products. In the skin\nand on the skin surface, 3 %to 5%and 2%to 4%, respectively,\nof the applied dose was present as hydrolysis products.\nIn Vivo—Nonhuman\nThe percutaneous penetration of radiolabeled diethyl malonate\nwas studied in vivo in the following animal models: athymic\nnude mouse, human, and pig skin grafted to athymic nude\nmice, in weanling pigs, and in hairless dogs.39[2-14C]Diethyl\nmalonate was applied at a dose of 0.1 mg/cm2for 24 hours to a\n1.27 cm2area of mouse skin, or for 48 hours to a 25 cm2area of\npigs and hairless dogs using nonoccluded applications. Accord-\ning to the authors, the percutaneous absorption, was estimated\nfrom the recovery of radioactivity in urine and feces and cor-\nrected for the recovery observed after parenteral (sc)Bergfeld et al 33STable 9.

A single 58 ml dose of 2000 mg/kg bw\n[14C]ditridecyl adipate was applied topically (size of test site\nnot specified), and urine and feces were collected for 4 days.\nIn the previously untreated rats, a total of 11.6 and 10.6 %of\nthe [14C] solution was absorbed by male and female rats,\nrespectively, over 4 days.

A total of\n0.7%to 1.3%of the [14C] was recovered in the urine and\n0.4%to 0.6%in the feces. Based on the radioactivity recov-\nered in the urine, the bioavailability of ditridecyl adipate\nwas 2%to 6%, and previous dosing did not significantly\naffect absorption.\nDiethylhexyl Adipate In Vitro. The in vitro hydrolysis of\ndiethylhexyl adipate (and m ono-(2-ethylheyxl) adipate\n[MEHA]) using tissue preparatio ns from the liver, pancreas,\nand small intestine of 2 rats was examined, as were the\neffects of diethylhexyl adipa te on serum and hepatic enzy-\nmatic activities in vitro.93Diethylhexyl adipate was readily\nhydrolyzed to MEHA or adipic acid by each tissue prepara-\ntion. The formation of adipic acid was rapid and approxi-\nmately the same for all 3 tissues, while the formation of\nMEHA was rapid only in pancreatic tissue and was negli-\ngible in the intestine. The rate of hydrolysis from MEHA to\nadipic acid was greater that th an from diethylhexyl adipate\nand the highest activity was fou nd in intestinal tissue. In\nexamining the effects on serum and hepatic enzymes, only\nN-demethylase activity was considerably inhibited by\ndiethylhexyl adipate.In Vivo—Nonhuman\nThe elimination, distribution, and metabolism of diethylhexyl\nadipate was investigated using male Wistar rats.93In these\nstudies, diethylhexyl adipate was labeled at the carbonyl car-\nbon. In elimination studies, 2 rats were dosed by gavage with\n500 mg/kg bw [14C]diethylhexyl adipate (1.26 mCi/rat) as a\nsaturated solution in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and respired\ncarbon dioxide, urine, and feces were collected for 2 days. At\n24 hours after dosing, 86 %of the administered dose was\nexcreted, and at 48 hours, more than 98 %o ft h ed o s ew a s\nexcreted. In 1 animal, 44.8 %of the dose was excreted in\nexpired carbon dioxide and 33.9 %in the urine at the 48 hours\nmeasurement, while in the other rat, 21.1 %and of the dose was\nexcreted in expired carbon dioxide and 52.2 %in the urine.\nLittle (1.4 or 5 %of the dose) was excreted in the feces.\nIn the distribution study, 3 rats per group were given a single\ndose as described above. The animals were killed at various\nintervals, and blood, organ, and tissue samples were collected.\nNot taking into account the stomach and intestines, the greatest\nlevels of radioactivity, as a percent of dose administered, were\nfound in the liver, kidney, blood, muscle, and adipose tissue.\nThese values ranged from 0.34 %to 8.21%at 6 hours, with the\ngreatest percentage found in the adipose tissue, and from\n0.54%to 3.44%at 12 hours, with the greatest percentage\nfound in the muscle. In most tissues, the amount of residual\nradioactivity reached a peak by 6 hours, except for the liver,\nkidneys, testicles, and musc le, which reached a peak at 12\nhours. The researchers stated that the elimination of radio-\nactivity from the tissues and org ans was very rapid, and there\nwas no specific organ affinity.\nThe metabolism of diethylhexyl adipate was examined in\nrats dosed orally, by gavage, with 100 mg of nonlabeled\ndiethylhexyl adipate as a 5 %solution in DMSO. A control\ngroup was dosed with vehicle only. The rats were killed 1, 3,\nor 6 hours after dosing. The metabolites were determined using\nGLC. Diethylhexyl adipate was rapidly hydrolyzed to adipic\nacid, the main intermediate metabolite, and MEHA. In the\nurine, adipic acid was detected at 1 hours, and excretion as\nadipic acid in the urine reached 20 %to 30%at 6 hours.\nDiethylhexyl adipate and MEHA were not detected in the\nurine. Adipic acid only also was detected in the blood and the\nliver, with constant excretion of 0.5 %to 0.7%of the dose in\nthe blood and excretion in the liver increasing with time, with 2 %\nto 3.3%excreted in the liver at 6 hours. In the stomach, diethyl-\nhexyl adipate, adipic acid, and MEHA were found. The concen-\ntrations of diethylhexyl adipate declined rapidly, while the levels\nof adipic acid (9 %to 10%) and MEHA (6 %to 11.5%) peaked at\n3 hours. Adipic acid, but not MEHA, was found in the intestine\nand increased with time, reaching 19 %at 6 hours.\nThe absorption, distribution, and elimination of diethyl-\nhexyl adipate was examined usi ng radioactive labeling on\nthe acid [carbonyl-14C] (specific activity 39.5 mCi/mmol) or\nthe alcohol [2-ethylhexyl-1-14C] (44.1 mCi/mmol).34The\nresearchers used both DMSO and commercial corn oil as vehi-\ncles for all tests, since the were of the opinion that DMSO is anTable 11.

Map of the sebacic and dodecanedioic ester ingredients in this assessment and associated esterase metabolites.Bergfeld et al 41Sactive penetrant and carrier of other substances through tissue\nmembranes. It was also their opinion that a fat-soluble sub-\nstance, such as diethylhexyl adipate, is more realistically stud-\nied dissolved in corn oil. The following groups of animals were\ndosed with 84.3 mg( 9mCi) [carbonyl14C]diethylhexyl adipate\nor 84.3 mg( 1 0mCi) [2-ethylhexyl-1-14C]diethylhexyl adipate\nin both vehicles: 12 male NMRI mice were dosed iv and killed\nat intervals from 5 minutes to 4 days after dosing; 10 male\nNMRI mice were dosed intragastrically (i.g.) and killed at\nintervals from 20 minutes to 4 days after dosing; 12 gravid\nNMRI mice were dosed iv or i.g. on day 17 of gestation and\nkilled at intervals from 20 minutes to 24 hours. Six male rats\nwere dosed i.g. with 843 mg( 9 0 mCi) [carbonyl14C]diethyl-\nhexyl adipate or 843 mg (100 mCi) [2-ethylhexyl-1-14C]diethyl-\nhexyl adipate and killed at intervals from 20 minutes to 4 hours.\nWhole body autoradiography was used to determine tissue\ndistribution.\nFollowing dosing with [carbonyl-14C]diethylhexyl adipate,\ndistribution was similar in male mice, male rats, and gravid\nmice. The amount of radioactivity in the tissues peaked at a\nlater time following i.g. dosing as compared to iv dosing. The\npresence of radioactivity in the gastrointestinal tract following\ni.v dosing indicated biliary excretion. Four hours following\nboth iv and i.g. dosing, the greatest uptake of radioactivity was\nfound in the liver, bone marrow, brown fat, adrenal cortex,\nkidneys, and a few other tissues. At 24 hours after i.g. dosing,\nsignificant levels of radioactivity remained in several tissues,\nincluding the liver, of both rats and mice. In gravid mice, a\n‘‘remarkable strong uptake’’ of radioactivity in the corpora\nlutea of the ovary was observed at all time intervals with both\niv and i.g. dosing, and some radioactivity was found in the fetal\nintestine, liver, and bone marrow.\nSimilar distribution pattern s were seen following dosing\nwith [2-ethylhexyl-1-14C]diethylhexyl adipate as were seen\nwith [carbonyl-14C]diethylhexyl adipate. Following i.g. dosing,\nthe appearance of radioactivity was lessened and not as great as\nit was with iv dosing. Very high radioactivity levels were seen\nin the liver and kidney at 5 minutes to 1 hour after iv dosing and\nat 20 minutes to 4 hours after i.g. dosing. The radioactivity in\nthe liver was still high at 24 hours after i.g. dosing in mice and\nrats. Radioactivity was also seen in the intestinal contents at 1\nto 4 hours after iv dosing, again indicating biliary excretion. At\nlonger intervals after iv injection, 4 hours-4 days, radioactivity\nwas detected in the bronchi of mice. While radioactivity was\nobserved in the ovaries of gravid mice and some fetal tissues\nfollowing dosing with [carbonyl-14C]diethylhexyl adipate,\nnone was detected in the ovaries of gravid mice after dosing\nwith [2-ethylhexyl-1-14C]diethylhexyl adipate, and very little\nradioactivity was seen in some fetal tissues.\nThe effect of vehicle on the absorption and biliary and urin-\nary excretion of diethylhexyl adipate was also examined using\nrats in a gavage study with [14C]diethylhexyl adipate. Radio-\nactivity was measured every 30 minutes for 7.5 hours. The\ntimes and extent of absorption were different for all 4 prepara-\ntions of [14C]diethylhexyl adipate. Radioactivity levels in the\nblood increased faster and were greater with DMSO as thevehicle, as compared to corn oil. The highest blood radioac-\ntivity levels were found with [carbonyl-14C]diethylhexyl adi-\npate in DMSO. Biliary excretion of [14C]diethylhexyl adipate\nwas greatly affected by vehicle; with DMSO, 41 %of the dose\nwas detected in the bile, while only 10 %of the dose was found\nwith the corn oil vehicle. This difference was not seen with\n[carbonyl-14C]diethylhexyl adipate. Finally, vehicle did not\nhave much influence on urinary excretion. However, unlike\nthe results reported by the previous researchers, little radio-\nactivity was excreted in the urine. The researchers hypothe-\nsized that since the study duration was only 7.5 hours, urinary\nexcretion may not have been complete.\nThe metabolism of diethylhexyl adipate was examined in\nvivo using male Wistar rats and compared to in vitro metabo-\nlism using hepatocytes.94In vivo, rats were dosed with 0.665 or\n1.5 g/kg diethylhexyl adipate in corn oil by gavage for 5 days,\nand the controls were given vehicle only. Urine was collected\ndaily. Diethylhexyl adipate was not recovered in the urine after\n24 hours. Adipic acid was the main metabolite of diethylhexyl\nadipate. In vitro, the first hydrolysis of diethylhexyl adipate\nappears to be a rate-limiting step. In vivo, it was thought that\nthis hydrolysis probably occurs in the gastrointestinal tract.\nMetabolic pathways ( oando-1oxidations, glucuronidation)\nseemed to prove that transformations of diethylhexyl adipate\nare localized mainly in the liver.\nOral administration of diethylhexyl adipate to cynomolgus\nmonkeys results in rapid elimination, with 47 %to 57%of the\ndose excreted in the urine.17Unchanged diethylhexyl adipate is\nabsorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and the glucuronide of\nMEHA and traces of unchanged diethylhexyl adipate were\nfound in the urine. (Details were not provided).\nIn Vivo—Human\nThe pharmacokinetics of [2H10]diethylhexyl adipate, labeled\non the ethyl side-chains, were examined using 6 male partici-\npants.95A dose of 46 mg [2H10]diethylhexyl adipate in corn oil,\nfor a total volume of 0.5 cm3, was administered orally in a\ngelatin capsule. Blood samples were taken for up to 31 hours\nafter dosing, and urine samples were taken at intervals for up to\n96 hours after dosing. In the plasma, unconjugated [2H5]2-\nethylhexanoic acid was the only measurable diethylhexyl\nadipate-related compound. This compound appeared rapidly\nin the plasma, and the peak concentrations (1.6 +0.5mg/\ncm3) occurred between 1 and 2 hours. [2H5]2-Ethylhexanol was\ndetected, but it was below the limit of quantification. The rate\nof metabolite formation was calculated, since there was no\nevidence of diethylhexyl adipate absorption, as 1.63 +1.19\nhr-1. The rate of elimination from the plasma was also rapid\nand estimated to be 0.42 +0.15/h, which corresponded to\nan elimination half-life of 1.6 5 hours. Although there were\ninter-individual differences in the rate and extent of [2H5]2-\nethylhexanoic acid formation, it was below the limit of detec-\ntion in all participants by 31 hours.\nIn the urine, [2H5]2-ethylhexanoic acid was again the prin-\ncipal metabolite, and it was probably eliminated as a42S International Journal of Toxicology 31(Supplement 1)conjugated product. This conjugated form, most likely the\nglucuronide, accounted for up to 99 %of the total [2H5]2\nethylhexanoic acid measured. Conjugation of the other urin-\nary metabolites was minimal. Pe ak urinary elimination of the\nmeasured metabolites occurre d within 8 hours of dosing, and\nno metabolites were detected in the urine after 36 hours. The\nrates of elimination were simila r for all metabolites, with a\nmean elimination half-life of 1.5 hours. The measured urinary\nmetabolites accounted for 12.1 %of the dose, with the major-\nity being eliminated in 24 hours. Fecal analysis determined\nthat a minor portion of the dose was present as diethylhexyl\nadipate (0.43 %)a n d[2H5]MEHA (0.27 %). The researchers\nnoted that recovery of the admi nistered dose was incomplete\nand hypothesized that it was most probably due to further\nsystemic metabolism.\nDiethylhexyl sebacate. Diethylhexyl sebacate is not readily\nabsorbed through the skin of guinea pigs (no further details\nwere provided).1It was noted that the metabolism of diethyl-\nhexyl sebacate in rodents and humans may follow partially\ncommon pathways.\nToxicologic studies\nPeroxisome Proliferation\nDiethylhexyl adipate is a per oxisome prolifer ator requiring\nextensive phase I metabolism to produce the proximate peroxi-\nsome proliferator, which in both mice and rats, appears to be 2-\nethylhexanoic acid.96,,,97Diethylhexyl adipate has been studied\nbecause it is structurally related to diethylhexyl phthalate,\nalthough diethylhexyl adipate is not as potent a proliferator\nas diethylhexyl phthalate.98,99\nPeroxisome proliferation causes an increase in liver weights\nand can induce hepatocarcinogenicity in rats and mice. Peroxi-\nsome proliferation is not believed to pose the risk of inducing\nhepatocarcinogenesis in human s, as a species difference in\nresponse to peroxisome proliferators exists.100In vitro and in\nvivo studies examining the induction of peroxisome prolifera-\ntion by diethylhexyl adipate and diethylhexyl sebacate are sum-\nmarized in Table 12.67,96-99,101,102While proliferation was\nobserved, these ingredients have much weaker activity than\ndiethylhexyl phthalate and ciprofibrate, which are very effec-\ntive peroxisome proliferators.\nHumans do not react to peroxisome proliferators in the man-\nner that rodents do.100There is no effect on organelle prolif-\neration and induction of perox isomal and microsomal fatty\nacid-oxidizing enzymes in species other than rats and mice,\nincluding humans. Consequently, these results have no rele-\nvance to humans.\nDNA Binding/DNA Synthesis\nDiethylhexyl adipate. The potential of diethylhexyl adipate to\nbind to liver DNA of female NMRI mice was evaluated by\nadministering a solution of 119 mg diethylhexyl adipate/mL\nwith 3.85 mCi/mL of [14C]diethylhexyl adipate (labelled at C1of the alcohol moiety) and 27.7 mCi/mL of [3H]diethylhexyl\nadipate (tritiated at positions 2 and 3 of the alcohol moiety) in\nolive oil.103The animals were dosed by gavage, and the livers\nwere excised 16 hours after dosing. Some animals were pre-\ntreated with 10 g/kg of unlabeled dietary diethylhexyl adipate\nfor 4 weeks. Diethylhexyl adipate did not covalently bind to\nhepatic DNA in mice. Pretreatment with diethylhexyl adipate\ncaused an increase in liver weight, but no increase in DNA\nbinding. The researchers stated that tumorigenicity of diethyl-\nhexyl adipate must be due to an activity other than DNA binding.\nThe ability of diethylhexyl adipate to stimulate liver DNA\nsynthesis in male F344 rats was investigated using radiolabeled\nthymidine.104Contrary to expected results, diethylhexyl adi-\npate did stimulate DNA synthesi s. The stimulation factor,\nwhich is indicated by the ratio of the thymidine incorporation\nin treated animals compared to controls, was 10.5 and the dou-\nbling dose, which is the dose that produced a doubling of the\ncontrol level DNA synthesis, was 0.7 mmol/kg.\nThe effect of dosing with diethylhexyl adipate on 8-\nhydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG) in liver and kidney DNA\nof rats was examined.105Groups of 10 male F344 rats were fed\na diet containing 0 or 2.5 diethylhexyl adipate. Five animals\nper group were killed after 1 week, and the other 5 after 2\nweeks of dosing. Relative liver to bws were statistically sig-\nnificantly increased after 1 and 2 weeks of dosing, and the\nrelative kidney to bws were statistically significantly\nincreased only after 2 weeks. A s tatistically significant\nincrease in 8-OH-dG was observed in the liver DNA, but not\nthe kidney DNA, at week 1 and 2.\nThe IARC remarked that the weight of evidence for diethyl-\nhexyl adipate, and other rodent peroxisome proliferators in\ngeneral, demonstrated that rodent peroxisome proliferators do\nnot act as direct DNA-damaging agents.17\nHepatic Lipid Metabolism\nDiethylhexyl adipate. Dietary administration of diethylhexyl\nadipate affects hepatic lipid metabolism.17Hepatic fatty acid-\nbinding protein and microsomal stearoyl-CoA desaturation\nwere increased in Wistar rats fed 2 %diethylhexyl adipate for\n7d a y s .106,107W h e nf e dt or a t sf o r1 4d a y s ,a ni n c r e a s ei n\nhepatic phospholipid levels and a decrease in phosphatidylcho-\nline:phosphatidylethanolamine ratio was reported.108In male\nNZB mice fed 2 %diethylhexyl adipate for 5 days, an induction\nof fatty acid translocase, fatty acid transporter protein, and fatty\nacid binding protein in the liver was reported.109\nCellular Effects\nDibutyl adipate. Dibutyl adipate was tested for cytotoxicity\nin the metabolic inhibition test. A dilution series of dibutyl\nadipate was suspended in HeLa cells. Dibutyl adipate had no\nacute toxicity to the cells, whi ch was attributed to its insolu-\nbility in water.5Bergfeld et al 43STable 12.

Male rats\nand mice fed 50 000 ppm and female rats and mice fed /C2125,000\nppm had decreased weight gains or weight loss. (It is not\nspecified whether the results were statistically significant.)\nOne female rat and all female mice of the 100 000 ppm\ngroup died.2\nIn a 14-day study in which 5 male and 5 female Wistar and\nF344 rats and Swiss and B6C3F 1mice were dosed with 0 to 2.5\ng/kg diethylhexyl adipate in corn oil for 14 days, diethylhexyl\nadipate was toxic to female B6C3F 1mice, causing mortality, at\na dose level of 2.5 g/kg.97The toxicity of 2 metabolites of\ndiethylhexyl adipate, 2-ethy lhexanol and 2-ethylhexanoic\nacid, was also examined usin g Wistar rats and Swiss mice.\n2-Ethylhexanol was toxic to male and female rats, with\nm o r t a l i t yr e p o r t e da td o s e s> 1 . 0 5g / k gi nm a l ea n df e m a l e\nrats. 2-Ethylhexanoic acid was toxic to female rats, with\nmortality reported at doses /C211.9 g/kg; mortality was not reported\nfor male rats. These effects were not reported in mice.\nIn a 1 and 4-week dietary study in which groups of 5 to 8 rats\nand mice were fed diets containing 0 %to 4.0%and 0%to 2.5%\ndiethylhexyl adipate, respectively, feed consumption by rats\nwas decreased in the 4.0 %group at 1 week and in the 2.5 and\n4.0%dose groups at 4 weeks.101Body weights were signifi-\ncantly decreased in these groups. Feed consumption by mice\nwas not affected, but a significant decrease in bws was seen in\nthe 1.2 and 2.5 %dose groups at 4 weeks.\nToxicity was evaluated in a study in which groups of 10\nfemale Crl:CD(SD) rats were dosed, by gavage, with 5 mL/\nkg of 0, 200, 1000, or 2000 mg/kg bw diethylhexyl adipate in\ncorn oil for 2 or 4 weeks.125All animals survived until study\ntermination. In the 2-week study, no statistically significantfindings were observed for the animals dosed with 200 mg/\nkg bw, and the only statistically significant finding in the\n1000 mg/kg bw dose group was an increase in relative liver\nto bw. In the 2000 mg/kg bw dose group, there was staining\naround the perineum, statistically significant increases in rela-\ntive liver and kidney to bws, and a statistically significant\ndecrease in the relative weight of the left ovary. Microscopi-\ncally, abnormal findings were reported for both the ovary and\nkidney. In the ovary, an increase in atresia of the large follicle\nand a decrease in currently formed corpora lutea were seen in\nanimals dosed with 1000 and 2000 mg/kg bw, and in the 2000\nmg/kg bw group, an increase in follicular cysts was observed.\nIn the kidney, an eosinophilic change of the proximal tubule\nwas observed for the 2000 mg/kg bw dose group. The NOAEL\nwas 200 mg/kg bw.\nIn the rats dosed for 4 weeks, similar observations were\nmade. There was staining around the perineum of animals\ndosed with 1000 and 2000 mg/kg bw diethylhexyl adipate, and\nfinal bws of animals dosed with 2000 mg/kg bw were statisti-\ncally significantly decreased. The relative kidney to bws were\nstatistically significantly increased in animals at all dose levels,\nand liver weights were statistically significantly increased in\nanimals of the 1000 and 2000 mg/kg bw dose groups. The mean\nestrous cycle length was statistically significantly decreased in\nthe 200 mg/kg bw dose group, but this was not considered\ntreatment-related since a dose-response was not seen. The same\nmicroscopic abnormalities reported in the 2 weeks study were\nseen in the ovaries and kidneys of the animals dosed with 1000\nand 2000 mg/kg bw in the 4-week study. As in the 2-week\nstudy, the NOAEL for ovarian toxicity was 200 mg/kg bw.\nIn a 13-week dietary study, groups of 10 rats and 10 mice\nwere fed /C2025 000 ppm diethylhexyl adipate. With the excep-\ntion of decreased weight gain for some of the groups, no\ncompound-related toxicologic effects were observed.2\nIn a 90-day dietary study, groups of 10 rats per group were\nfed 0 to 4740 mg/kg bw diethylhexyl adipate for 90 days.113\nMortality occurred in the 4740 mg/kg bw group, but the num-\nber of deaths was not specified. Decreased growth and feed\nconsumption was reported for animals fed 2920 mg/kg bw.\nChanges in kidney and liver weights were noted, but no details\nwere given. The NOEL was 610 mg/kg bw, and the LOEL was\n2920 mg/kg bw diethylhexyl adipate.\nGroups of 15 male and 15 female Sprague Dawley rats were\nf e d0o r2 . 5 %diethylhexyl adipate for 90 days.92At study\ntermination, all animals were killed for necropsy. Body weight\ngains were statistically signif icantly decreased for treated\nmales and females, and relative kidney and liver to bws were\nstatistically significantly increased for treated females, when\ncompared to controls.\nIn a 13-week dietary study in which groups of 5 to 8 rats and\nmice were fed diets containing 0 %to 4.0%and 0%to 2.5%\ndiethylhexyl adipate, feed consumption by rats was decreased\nin the 2.5 and 4.0 %dose groups, and bws were significantly\nreduced in these groups.101Feed consumption by mice was not\naffected, but a significant decrease in bws was seen in the 1.2\nand 2.5%dose groups.Bergfeld et al 45STable 13.

No animals of the 2060 mg/kg bw\ngroup died, but 3 of the 4 did not gain weight, and they\nhad labored breathing and were lethargic during week 2. Mod-\nerate erythema was observed in this group. Microscopically, 1\nanimal of the 2060 mg/kg bw group had altered cytology of\nthe liver parenchymal cells. No other microscopic lesions\nwere noted.\nDiisopropyl adipate. An immersion study was performed\nusing guinea pigs in which a product containing 20.75 %diiso-\npropyl adipate was diluted, giving an actual adipate concentra-\ntion of 0.10 %. The animals were immersed 4 h/d for 3 days.\nThere were no signs of systemic toxicity, and the degree of\ndermal irritation was considered minimal.2\nDiethylhexyl sebacate. No deaths occurred when 4 rats, 2\nguinea pigs, 2 rabbits and 1 cat were exposed to 400 mg\ndiethylhexyl sebacate/m3, 7 h/d, for 10 days.1Details were not\nprovided.\nGroups of 12 F344 rats, gender not specified, were exposed\n4 hours/d, 5 days/week, to 25 or 250 mg/m3diethylhexyl\nsebacate for /C2013 weeks.92No adverse systemic or lung\neffects were observed.\nDiethyl malonate. Groups of 10 to 16 male and female CD\nrats were fed diets containing either 0, 36 (males) or 41 mg/kg\nbw/d (females) diethyl malonate for 90 days.39No treatment\nrelated effects were observed.\nDi-C7-9 branched and linear alkyl esters of adipic acid. Groups\nof 15 male and 15 female Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a diet\ncontaining 0, 0.1, 0.5, or 2.5 %di-C7-9 branched and linear\nalkyl esters of adipic acid for 90 days, corresponding to approx-\nimately 1500 mg/kg bw/d for high-dose males and 1900 mg/kg\nbw/d for high-dose females.92All rats were killed for necropsy\nat study termination. No systemic toxicity was reported. Small,\nbut significant, increases in absolute and relative kidney to bws\nreported for females of the 2.5 %dose group were not consid-\nered treatment-related. The NOAELs for male and female rats\nwere 1500 and 1950 mg/kg bw/d, respectively.Diisononyl adipate. Groups of 10 male and 10 female rats\nwere fed 0, 50, 150, or 500 mg/kg bw diisononyl adipate for\n13 weeks.92A statistically significant increase in relative kid-\nney to bws was reported for males and females given 500 mg/\nkg bw, but absolute kidney weights were not affected and no\nsignificant microscopic eff ects were seen. Microscopic\nchanges in any of the organs, including the testes and epididy-\nmis of males and ovaries of females, were not observed. There\nwere no significant toxicological findings, and the NOAEL was\n500 mg/kg bw/d.\nIn another 13-week study, groups of 4 male and 4 female\nBeagle dogs were fed 0, 0.3, 1.0, or 3.0 %diisononyl adipate;\nthe high dose was increased to 6 %during weeks 9 to 13.92No\nsignificant findings were reported for the 0.3 or 1.0 %groups. In\nthe high-dose group, decreased bws, testes weight, and feed\nconsumption, increased liver weights, elevated enzyme levels,\nliver and kidney discoloration, and microscopic changes in the\nliver, testes, spleen, and kidneys were reported. The dietary\nNOAEL for diisononyl adipate was 1.0 %.\nDitridecyl adipate. Ditridecyl adipate, 0, 800, or 2000 mg/kg\nbw, was applied to the backs of groups of 10 male and 10\nfemale Sprague-Dawley rats, 5 days/week for 13 weeks.92The\ntest sites were not occluded, but the animals wore Elizabethan\ncollars. Slight erythema and flaking of the skin was observed in\nthe treated groups, with hyperplasia of the sebaceous glands in\nthe dermis, but otherwise no significant differences were\nobserved between test and control animals. Differences in rela-\ntive organ to bws were not statistically significant, and ditride-\ncyl adipate did not appear to cause systemic toxicity.\nDibutyl sebacate. Groups of 5 male and 5 female Sprague-\nDawley rats were fed a diet containing 0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.25, or\n1.25%dibutyl sebacate for 1 year.122Necropsies were per-\nformed whenever rats exhibited significant weight losses or\nother evidences of severe concurrent infection. Dibutyl sebacate\nhad no effect on growth or well-being.\nThe researches then fed groups of 16 male Sprague Dawley\nrats a diet containing 0.01, 0.05, 0.25, 1.25, or 6.25 %dibutyl\nsebacate for 2 years.122Two control groups were given\nuntreated feed. Necropsies were performed on 3 rats from each\ngroup after 1yr, and the experiment was terminated at the end\nof the 2-year feeding period. Interim, animals were killed\nwhenever they became moribund. In such instances the rats\nusually had incapacitating tumors or severe intercurrent infec-\ntions. Dibutyl sebacate did not adversely affect growth or sur-\nvival, and it did not produce significant hematological changes\nin peripheral blood. As the rats increased in age, slight changes\nin distribution of leukocytes were found, but these trends\noccurred in both the control and treatment groups.\nOcular Irritation\nOcular irritation data on esters of dicarboxylic acids and ester-\nase metabolites are presented in Table 14.Bergfeld et al 49SDiethyl malonate.

At 24 hours, the maximum mean total score\n(MMTS) was 0.00, and dioctyl dodecyl dodecanedioate was\nconsidered not irritating.\nDiisocetyl dodecanedioate. The primary eye irritation of\ndiisocetyl dodecanedioate was e valuated using the procedure\ndescribed above.128The MMTS was 0.00, and diisocetyl\ndodecanedioate was considered not irritating to the eyes of\nrabbits.\nComedogenicity\nDibutyl adipate. Dibutyl adipate, 10 %to 100%(vehicle not\nstated), was not comedogenic in clinical testing.5\nDermal Irritation/Sensitization\nNonhuman dermal irritation and sensitization data on esters of\ndicarboxylic acids and esterase metabolites are presented in\nTable 15. Human dermal irritation and sensitization data on\nesters of dicarboxylic acids and esterase metabolites are pre-\nsented in Table 16.\nDimethyl Malonate Nonhuman. Dimethyl malonate was\na p p l i e du n d i l u t e dt or a b b i ts k i nf o r4h o u r su n d e ras e m i -\nocclusive patch.39Slight erythema was observed only at 30\nto 60 minutes after patch removal, and dimethyl malonate was\nconsidered nonirritating to rabbit skin.\nDimethyl malonate was not a sensitizer in a Buehler guinea\npig sensitization test according to OECD TG 406.39\nHuman. The sensitization potential of 8 %dimethyl malonate\nin petrolatum was evaluated in a maximization test using 25\nparticipants.39Dimethyl malonate was not a sensitizer.Diethyl Malonate. The dermal irritation potential of diethyl\nmalonate was evaluated using a 24 hours occlusive applica-\ntion.39Diethyl malonate was slightly irritating to rabbit skin.\nDibutyl Adipate Nonhuman. Application of undiluted butyl\nadipate to rabbit skin resulted in a primary irritation score of\n2/8. Undiluted dibutyl adipate caused moderate erythema in\nrabbits following repeated dermal exposure. However, material\nimpregnated with dibutyl adipate was not irritating to the skin\nof rabbits. Application of dibutyl adipate at 10 %in acetone\nproduced no observable adverse effect when applied to rabbit\nears, and no dermal reaction was observed following twice\ndaily application for 14 days to the backs of hairless mice. Two\nperfume formulations containing 1.1 %diisopropyl adipate\nwere not primary dermal irritants using rabbits5\nDibutyl adipate was not a dermal sensitizer in guinea pigs\nwhen tested at 25 %in a maximization test.5\nHuman. Undiluted dibutyl adipate was not irritating in a\n24-hr clinical patch test with 10 participants. Slight reactions\n(not defined) were reported for 4 of 18 participants in a 24-hour\npatch test with dibutyl adipate, 20 %in alcohol.5\nDiisopropyl Adipate Nonhuman. Draize tests of undiluted dii-\nsopropyl adipate resulted in, at most, mild irritation of rabbit\nskin. In Draize tests with formulations containing 5.0 %or\n20.75%diisopropyl adipate, minimal irritation was reported\nwith both formulations.2\nHuman. The dermal irritation and sensitization of diisopro-\npyl adipate was evaluated in a number of studies. Undiluted\ndiisopropyl adipate produced no irritation in 4 hours patch\ntests, but was moderately irritating in a 21-day cumulative\nirritancy test. Formulations containing 0.26 %to 20.75 %diiso-\npropyl adipate caused minimal to mild irritation, but no\nsensitization.2\nDiethylhexyl Adipate Nonhuman. Undiluted diethylhexyl adi-\npate was a very mild irritant when applied under occlusion to\nintact and abraded rabbit skin. A formulation containing\n0.175%diethylhexyl adipate had an irritation index of 1.6/4.2\nDiethylhexyl adipate, 0.1 %, was not a sensitizer in a max-\nimization study using guinea pigs.2\nHuman. The dermal irritation and sens itization of diethyl-\nhexyl adipate was evaluated in a number of studies with for-\nmulations containing 0.01 %to 9%diethylhexyl adipate. Mild\nreactions were seen with a formulations containing 0.01 %.\nUsing a formulation containing 0.7 %, on participant reacted\nstrongly following the second c hallenge, with erythema and\npapules observed. Strong reac tions were seen for 3 partici-\npants in a patch test of a formulation containing 9.0 %diethyl-\nhexyl adipate.2\nDiisodecyl Adipate, Dioctyldodecyl Adipate, Diisocetyl Adipate.\nThe dermal irritation potential of diisodecyl adipate, dioctyl-\ndodecyl adipate and diisocetyl adipate was determined usingBergfeld et al 51STable 15.

The\nerythema scores for each of the 3 materials were 0 to 1 during\n1 to 72 hours, and the edema scores were 0. Diisodecyl adi-\npate, dioctyldodecyl adipate and diisocetyl adipate were con-\nsidered nonirritating to rabbit skin.\nDiisostearyl Adipate. A human repeat insult patch test\n(HRIPT) using 50 participants was used to evaluate the irrita-\ntion and sensitization potential of diisostearyl adipate.135Two-\ntenths mL was applied neat to the back of each participant\nunder an occlusive patch for 24 hours, after which time the\nparticipant removed the patch. This procedure was performed\n3 times per week for 3 weeks, for a total of 9 induction patches.\nFollowing a 10 to 14 day nontreatment period, a 24-hour chal-\nlenge patch was applied to a previously untreated site, andreactions were scored at 24 and 48 hours. No adverse reactions\nwere observed, and diisostearyl adipate was not a primary irri-\ntant or a sensitizer.\nDiethyl Sebacate Nonhuman. Undiluted diethyl sebacate and\n30%diethyl sebacate in ethanol were tested on 8 male Japanese\nWhite strain rabbits (gender not specified).117The flank of the\nanimals was clipped free of hair 1 day prior to application of\ntest substance. The skin of 4 animals was abraded. The test\nsubstance, 0.3 mL, was applied occlusively to the back of all\nanimals for 24 hours. The skin reactions were evaluated at 24\nhours and 72 hours. The primary irritation score was 0.0 (none\nto weak irritant) in undiluted die thyl sebacate and 0.3 (none to\nweak irritant) in 30 %diethyl sebacate. These results suggest\nthat 100 %diethyl sebacate has no primary skin irritation\nunder these test conditions.Table 15. (continued)\nDose/Conc.

A single insult occlusive patch test (SIOPT) was\nperformed using 20 participants to determine the irritation poten-\ntial of a body cream containing 1.5 %diethyl sebacate.136The\ntest patch was applied for 24 hours. The PII was 0.00, and the\nbody cream containing 1.5 %diethyl sebacate was nonirritating.\nThe sensitization potential of a body cream containing 1.5 %\ndiethyl sebacate was evaluated in a maximization study.137\nDuring induction, 0.05 mL of 0.25 %aqueous sodium lauryl\nsulfate (SLS) was applied under an occlusive patch for 24\nhours. At that time, the patch was removed and 0.05 mL of the\ntest material was applied to the same site under an occlusive\npatch for 48 to 72 hours. If no irritation was present at the test\nsite upon patch removal, an occlusive patch with 0.25 %aqu-\neous SLS was applied for 24 hours, followed by a patch of the\ntest material. This sequence was used for 5 induction patches. If\nirritation developed during induction, the SLS patch was elim-\ninated. After a 10-day nontreatment period, a challenge was\nperformed at a previously untreated site. The challenge site was\npretreated with 0.05 mL of 5.0 %aqueous SLS under an occlu-\nsive patch for 1 hour, followed by an occlusive patch of the test\nmaterial for 48 hours. Twenty-five participants completed the\nstudy. No reactions were seen at challenge, and a body cream\ncontaining 1.5 %diethyl sebacate did not have contact-\nsensitizing potential.\nA number of investigators have reported cases of allergic\ncontact dermatitis in response to diethyl sebacate-containing\nproducts, and have demonstrated diethyl sebacate to be the\nsubstance, or 1 of several substances in the products, eliciting\nthe dermatitis.31,154-158\nDiisopropyl Sebacate Nonhuman. A primary dermal irritation\ns t u d yo nd i i s o p r o p y ls e b a c a t ew a sp e r f o r m e du s i n g6N e w\nZealand white rabbits.126A dermal application of 0.5 mL of\nundiluted test material was applied to an abraded and an intact\nsite on each animal. The test sites were occluded for 24 hours\nand observed individually for erythema, edema, and other\neffects 24 and 72 hours after application. Mean scores from\nthe 24 and 72 hours reading were averaged to give a primary\nirritation index (PII) of 2.88. Diisopropyl sebacate was not\nconsidered a primary dermal irritant.\nThe dermal irritation potential of diisopropyl sebacate was\ndetermined using 3 albino rabbits.117Undiluted test material\nwas applied to the skin for 4 hours under a semi-occlusive\npatch. The erythema scores were 1 during 1 to 72 hours, and\nthe edema scores were 0 to 1. Diisopropyl sebacate was con-\nsidered nonirritating to rabbit skin.\nHuman. An SIOPT was performed using 20 participants to\ndetermine the irritation potential of a foundation containing\n1.8%diisopropyl sebacate.139The patch was applied for 24\nhour. The foundatio n containing 1.8 %diisopropyl sebacate\nwas not irritating.\nThe irritation and sensitization potential of diisopropyl seba-\ncate was evaluated in a patch test that consisted of four 24-hour\napplications of diisopropyl s ebacate as supplied (approxi-\nmately 100 %) during weeks 1, 2, 3, and 6 on a 2 cm x2 cmarea of skin on the right upper arm of each participant.139\nExaminations were performed immediately after patch\nremoval. The induction phase was performed during weeks 1\nto 4 using 107 participants. No clinically significant effects\nwere detected on any of the participants during this phase.\nDuring week 6, the challenge phase was conducted on 105\nparticipants. No clinically significant effects were noted in any\nof the participants during this phase. Diisopropyl sebacate was\nnot observed to have any significant skin-irritating or sensitiz-\ning activity under the conditions of this study.\nA maximization assay was performed, using a modified\nprotocol of the maximization assay procedure described earlier,\nto determine the contact-sensitization potential of a foundation\ncontaining 2.2 %diisopropyl sebacate.140In this study, the test\nmaterial was allowed to volatilize for 30 minutes before the\nocclusive patch was applied. Twenty-five participants com-\npleted the study. No reactions were seen at challenge, and a\nfoundation containing 2.2 %diisopropyl sebacate did not have\ncontact-sensitizing potential.\nTwo heat protection hair spray products containing 1 %dii-\nsopropyl sebacate were tested using a modified Draize HRIPT\nprocedure to determine the potential of those products to\ninduce irritation and contact sensitization.141The products\nwere tested neat and allowed to volatilize prior to patch appli-\ncation. Samples were patched under semi-occlusive conditions.\nApproximately 0.2ml was used in each patch. One hundred ten\nparticipants completed the study. Generally transient, barely\nperceptible (0.5-level) to mild (1-level) patch test responses\non 22 test participants for 1 formulation and only barely per-\nceptible (0.5-level) patch test response on 15 test participants\nwith the other formulation during the induction and/or chal-\nlenge phases of the study were reported. Both products were\nconsidered to be nonirritating and nonsensitizing.\nA heat protection hair spray product containing 7.2 %diiso-\npropyl sebacate was tested using an HRIPT to determine the\npotential of this product to induce irritation and contact sensi-\ntization.142The product was tested neat under semi-occlusive\nconditions. Approximately 0.2 mL sample was used in each\npatch. Fifty-one participants completed the study. No skin reac-\ntivity was observed in any of the test participants during the\ncourse of the study.\nTwo case studies were reported of allergic reactions to\nlotion containing diisopropyl sebacate.159,160\nDiethylhexyl Sebacate Nonhuman. The dermal irritation poten-\ntial of diethylhexyl sebacate was evaluated using the same\nprocedure.118The erythema scores were 1 during 1 to 72 hours,\nand the edema scores were 0. Diethylhexyl sebacate was con-\nsidered nonirritating to rabbit skin.\nPatch tests with diethylh exyl sebacate (neat; 48-hr\noccluded) did not irritate the skin of 2 to 4 rabbits.1It was also\nreported that diethylhexyl sebacate was nonirritating to the skin\nof guinea pigs. No further study details were provided.\nA limited attempt was made to sensitize a group of 2 to 4\nrabbits by applying diethylhexyl sebacate using occlusive\npatches.1No reactions were seen in an occlusive challenge56S International Journal of Toxicology 31(Supplement 1)with the undiluted test article 2 weeks later. Details were not\nprovided.\nHuman. Diethylhexyl sebacate was applied neat using occlu-\nsive patches to the skin of 15 to 30 participants (sex not spec-\nified) for 48-hour.1No local reactions were observed in the\nchallenge phase (48-hour covered contact with neat liquid) that\nwas carried out 2 weeks later, presumably due to limited\ninduction.\nIn a case study where 1 patient was sensitized to other\nsebacate esters, a patch test with diethylhexyl sebacate did not\nelicit a response.159\nDioctyldodecyl Dodecanedioate Nonhuman. A maximization\ntest was performed to evaluate the sensitization potential of\ndioctyldodecyl dodecanedioate.134Ten female guinea pigs\nwere used. The dose used at intradermal injection was 0.1\nmL, and 0.5 mL was used for the topical challenge. Slight\nerythema was observed at induction, but a sensitization reac-\ntion was not observed.\nHuman\nDioctyldodecyl Dodecanedioate. An HRIPT with 50 partici-\npants was performed to evaluate the irritation and sensitization\npotential of dioctyldodecyl dodecanedioate.135Two-tenths\nmilliliter of the test material, neat, was applied to the back of\neach participant under an occlusive patch for 24 hours, after\nwhich time the participant removed the patch. This procedure\nwas performed 3 times per week for 3 weeks, for a total of 9\ninduction patches. Following a 10- to 14-day nontreatment\nperiod, a 24 hours challenge patch was applied to a previously\nuntreated site, and reactions were scored at 24 and 48 hours. No\nadverse reactions were observed, and dioctyldodecyl dodeca-\nnedioate was not a primary irritant or a sensitizer.\nDiisocetyl dodecanedioate. An HRIPT with 50 participants\nwas performed as described above to evaluate the irritation and\nsensitization potential of diisocetyl dodecanedioate.135No\nadverse reactions were observed, and diisocetyl dodecanedio-\nate was not a primary irritant or a sensitizer.\nPhototoxicity\nDibutyl adipate. Dibutyl adipate, as a 10 %dilution in liquid\nparaffin, was not phototoxic in a clinical phototoxicity study\nusing 30 participants.5\nDiethylhexyl adipate. In a photopatch test on 9.0 %diethyl-\nhexyl adipate using 25 participants, no phototoxic or photoal-\nlergic reactions were observed.2\nDiisopropyl Adipate\nNonhuman.

Groups of 10 male and 10 female Wistar\nrats were dosed with 0, 100, 300, or 1000 mg/kg bw dimethyl\nmalonate orally, by gavage.39Males were dosed for 2 weeks\nprior to mating, during mating, and 2 weeks after mating, for a\ntotal of 39 doses. Females were dosed 2 weeks prior to mating,\nduring mating, and through day 4 of lactation. A recovery\ngroup of 5 male and 5 female high-dose animals were observed\nfor 14 days after the termination of dosing. Microscopically,\nthe incidence of treatment-related hepatocellular hypertrophy\nof the liver was observed for males and females given 1000 mg/\nkg bw dimethyl malonate. This effect was not observed in the\nrecovery animals or in the other test groups. No other signifi-\ncant toxicological effects wer e observed. Performance in a\nfunctional observation battery was similar for test and control\nanimals. There was no effect on fertility. In the 100 mg/kg bw\ngroup, a statistically significant decrease in the number of live\npups was due to an increase in post-implantation loss. This\neffect was not considered treatment related, and no develop-\nmental toxicity was reported. The NOAEL was 300 mg/kg bw\nfor repeated doses and maternal toxicity and 1000 mg/kg bw\nfor fertility and developmental toxicity.\nDimethyl Adipate. Groups of 5 gravid Sprague Dawley rats\nwere dosed ip with 0.0603 to 0.6028 mL/kg dimethyl adipate\n(1/30, 1/10, 1/5, and 1/3 of the ip LD 50value) on days 5, 10, and\n15 of gestation.124A pooled volume control consisted of ani-\nmals dosed with 10 mL/kg distilled water, saline, or cottonseed\noil. A positive control group was not used. All animals were\nkilled and examined on day 20 of gestation. The mean fetal\nweights and the numbers of live fetuses were not statistically\nsignificantly different between treated and blunt-needle control\ngroups. Resorptions in animals dosed with 0.1809 mL/kg were\nstatistically significantly increased when compared to the\npooled controls, but not the blunt-needle controls. Gross and\nskeletal abnormalities, but not visceral, were statistically sig-\nnificantly increased in fetuses of the 0.3617 and 0.6028 mL/kg\ngroups. The NOEL was 0.0603 mL/kg dimethyl adipate.\nDiethyl Adipate. Following the same procedure described\nabove, rats were dosed ip with 0.0837 to 0.8373 mL/kg diethyl\nadipate.124The mean fetal weight and the number of live\nfetuses were not statistically significantly different between\ntreated and blunt-needle control groups, and the number of\nresorptions was similar between treated animals and both the\nblunt needle and pooled controls. There were no differences inBergfeld et al 57Sthe incidences of gross, skeletal, or visceral abnormalities in\nfetuses of the treated groups compared to pooled controls.\nDipropyl Adipate. Following the same procedure described\nabove, rats were dosed ip with 0.1262 to 1.2619 mL/kg dipro-\npyl adipate.124The numbers of live and dead fetuses were not\nstatistically significantly different between treated and blunt-\nneedle control groups, but there was a statistically significant\ndecrease in the mean fetal weight of the 0.7572 mL/kg group.\nResorptions in animals dosed with 1.2619 mL/kg were statis-\ntically significantly increased when compared to the pooled\ncontrols, but not the blunt-needle controls. Gross abnormal-\nities, but not skeletal or visceral, were statistically signifi-\ncantly increased in fetuses of the 1.2619 mL/kg group. The\nNOEL was 0.1262 mL/kg dipropyl adipate.\nDibutyl Adipate. Groups of 5 gravid Sprague Dawley rats\nwere dosed ip with 0.1748 to 1.7480 mL/kg dibutyl adipate\non days 5, 10, and 15 of gestation. The incidence of gross\nabnormalities was only statistically significantly increased in\nthe high-dose group when compared to pooled controls.5\nDibutyl adipate was evaluated in a study Sprague-Dawley\nrats.110Groups of 13 male and 13 female rats were dosed with\n0, 100, 300, or 1000 mg/kg bw dibutyl adipate orally, by\ngavage, for 14 days prior to mating through parturition; males\nwere dosed for a total of 42 days and female dams were dosed\nuntil day 3 of lactation. The test article had no effect on ferti-\nlity. Body weight gains of males of the 1000 mg/kg bw group\nwere slightly decreased. Kidney weights of the high-dose males\nand females sere increased compared to controls. No gross or\nmicroscopic effects were noted at necropsy, and the internal\ngenitalia were normal. Dosing with dibutyl adipate did not\nproduce any reproductive effects. The only effect on the off-\nspring was a decrease in pup weight on post-natal days 0 and 4\nand in viability on post-natal day 4 in the 1000 mg/kg group.\nThe NOEL for parental and offspring toxicity was 300 mg/kg\nbw/d. The reproductive NOEL was 1000 mg/kg bw/d.\nDi-C7-9 Branched and Linear Alkyl Esters of Adipic Acid. Groups\nof 24 gravid Sprague Dawley rats were dosed orally by gavage\nwith 0, 1000, 4000, or 7000 mg/kg bw/d di-C7-9 branched and\nlinear alkyl esters of adipic acid on days 6 to 19 of gestation,\nand all animals were killed and examined on day 20.92All\ndams survived until study termination. Body weights were sig-\nnificantly decreased for dams of the 7000 mg/kg bw group.\nWeights of male and female fetuses of the 7000 mg/kg bw\ngroup were slightly, but not statistically significantly,\ndecreased compared to the other groups. A greater incidence\nof rudimentary structures was observed for high-dose fetuses as\ncompared to the other groups in this study, but the incidence\nwas within the range of historical controls. There was no evi-\ndence of developmental toxicity at any dose tested.\nDitridecyl Adipate. Groups of 15 mated female Sprague-\nDawley rats were given doses of 0, 800, and 2000 mg/kg bw\nof ditridecyl adipate applied dermally without occlusion on\ndays 0 to 19 of gestation, and the dams were killed on day20.92. Mild skin irritation consisting of erythema and flaking\nwere observed at the test sites of the treated animals. No mater-\nnal mortality was reported. Weight gains were statistically sig-\nnificantly decreased for the 2000 mg/kg bw group during days\n0 to 3 and 16 to 20 of gestation. Weight gains were statistically\nsignificantly decreased in the 800 mg/kg bw group during days\n0 to 3 of gestation. No differences in skeletal anomalies were\nobserved, but there were some differences in visceral anomalies,\nincluding increased incidence of levocardia at 2000 mg/kg bw.\nThese anomalies were not considered treatment-related. The\nNOAEL for maternal toxicity was 2000 mg/kg bw/d, and for\ndevelopmental and reproductive effects it was 800 mg/kg bw/d.\nGroups of 25 mated female rats were dosed dermally with 0\nand 2000 mg/kg bw ditridecyl adipate following the same study\nprotocol as above. Again, there were no signs of maternal\ntoxicity. No developmental toxicity was reported, and there\nwere no visceral anomalies or levocardia.\nTridecyl adipate, 2000 mg/kg bw, was applied, unoccluded,\nto groups of 10 male Sprague-Dawley rats, 5 days/week for 13\nweeks, and the effect on sperm morphology was evaluated.92\n(The ‘Subchronic Dermal Toxicity’ study was described ear-\nlier.) No differences in sperm morphology were observed\nbetween control and test animals.\nDiisobutyl Adipate. Diisobutyl adipate was evaluated follow-\ning the procedure described earlier in the ip study.124These rats\nwere dosed ip with 0.1983 to 1.9833 mL/kg diisobutyl adipate.\nThe numbers of live and dead fetuses were not statistically\nsignificantly different between treated and blunt-needle control\ngroups, but there was a statistically significant decrease in the\nmean fetal weight of the 1.1900 and 0.9833 mL/kg dose groups.\nThe number of resorptions was similar between treated animals\nand both the blunt needle and pooled controls. Gross abnorm-\nalities, but not skeletal or visceral, were statistically signifi-\ncantly increased in fetuses of the 0.5950 and 1.9833 mL/kg\ngroups.\nDiethylhexyl Adipate. Groups of 10 male Swiss mice were\ndosed ip with /C209.3 g/kg diethylhexyl adipate and then mated\nwith undosed females. A reduction in the number of gravid\nfemales was considered an anti-fertility effect, and the domi-\nnant lethal mutation was determined directly from the dose-\ndependent increase in the number of early fetal deaths and\nindirectly from the dose- an d time-dependent decrease in\nimplantations. There were no test article-related changes in the\nincidence of late fetal deaths. It was noted that the experimental\nd e s i g na n di n t e r p r e t a t i o nh a v eb e e nq u e s t i o n e db ys o m e .\nDiethylhexyl adipate, /C209.3 g/kg, was administered by ip injec-\ntion to groups of 5 gravid Sprague Dawley rats on day 5, 10,\nand 15 of gestation. Resorption rates were similar to controls. A\ndecrease in the mean fetal bw and a significant increase in gross\nfetal abnormalities at the high dose were observed when com-\npared to pooled control values. However teratogenic effects\nwere not observed when compared to concurrent controls. It\nwas stated that the lack of historical and positive controls\naffected the validity of the results.258S International Journal of Toxicology 31(Supplement 1)Groups of 15 male and 30 female Wistar rats were fed a diet\ncontaining 0, 0.03, 0.18, or 1.2 %diethylhexyl adipate (calcu-\nlated as 28, 170, or 1080 mg/kg bw/d) for 10 weeks prior to\nmating.92Dosing was terminated, and the animals were mated.\n(A different source indicated that dosing continued throughout\nthe study).161A reduction in bw gain was reported during\ngestation for the dams of the 1.2 %group. No test article-\nrelated effects on fertility were observed. Fetal weight, total\nlitter weight, and litter size were reduced in the 1.2 %group, but\nthe number of pups born live, or their survival, was not\naffected. The NOAEL was 170 mg/kg bw/d and the LOAEL\nwas 1080 mg/kg bw/d.\nIn another study in which gravid females were fed the same\ndoses as above on days 1 to 22 of gestation, maternal bw and\nfeed consumption were statis tically decreased in the 1.2 %\ngroup. No significant effects on fetal weight or litter size were\nreported. Animals of the 0.18 and 1.2 %groups had slightly\nincreased incidences of minor skeletal abnormalities; this\nincrease was attributed to fetotoxicity. The NOEL for maternal\ntoxicity was 170 mg/kg bw/d. The NOAELs for developmental\ntoxicity and fetotoxicity were 170 and 28 mg/kg bw/d, respec-\ntively. The LOAEL was 1080 mg/kg bw day.\nA dose-range finding study was performed using groups of 8\ngravid Wistar rats that were dosed by gavage with 2 mL/kg of\n0, 800, or 1200 mg/d diethylhexyl adipate, in peanut oil, from\nday 7 of gestation until day 17 after parturition.162No signs of\ntoxicity were reported in any of the groups. In the 800 mg/kg\nbw group, the only statistically significant observation made\nwas decreased bws of male and female pups on day 3. In the\n1200 mg/kg bw group, statistic ally significant effects were\nobserved for a number of parameters, including decreased\nmaternal weight gain during days 7 to 21 of gestation,\nincreased length of gestation (by 1 day), decreased pup bws\nat birth and day 3, and an increase in perinatal loss per litter.\n(Perinatal loss was 42 %in the 1200 mg/kg bw groups, as\ncompared to 4.6 %in controls.)\nBased on the results of the dose-range finding study, groups\nof 20 gravid Wistar rats were dosed with 2 mL/kg of 0, 200,\n400, or 800 mg/kg bw diethylhexyl adipate, in peanut oil, from\nday 7 of gestation until post-natal day 17. At postnatal day 21,\nall dams and pups were killed, with the exception that 1 male\nand 1 female pup per litter was kept for further evaluation. No\nsigns of toxicity were reported in any of the groups. No signif-\nicant effects were observed in the 200 mg/kg bw group. In the\n400 mg/kg bw dose groups, the number of postnatal deaths per\nnumber of pups was statistically significant increased. In the\n800 mg/kg bw group, statistically significant effects were\nobserved for a number of parameters, including increased\nlength of gestation (by 1 day), decreased pup bws at birth and\ndays 3 and 13, increased mean number of postnatal deaths, and\nan increase in postnatal death per number of pups. The percent-\nage of perinatal loss per litter was twice as high in the 400 and\n800 mg/kg bw groups (23 %) as compared to controls (11 %),\nbut the change was not statistically significant. Testicular tes-\ntosterone levels were unaffected in any of the pups that were\nkilled on postnatal day 21 or the adult male offspring, andserum luteinizing hormone and prolactin levels were similar\nto controls. None of the sperm parameters that were evaluated\nwere affected by dosing. The on ly statistically significant\neffects, noted in the 800 mg/kg bw group, were increased\nrelative liver to bws in male pups on day 21 and increased\nbws and decreased adrenal weights in adult male offspring.\nDiethylhexyl adipate did not produce any antiandrogenic\neffects in the study. Fetal steroidogenesis was not evaluated.\nNOAEL was 200 mg/kg bw.\nGroups of 10 female Crl:CD(SD) rats were dosed with\n5 mL/kg, by gavage, of 0, 200, 1000, or 2000 mg/kg bw\ndiethylhexyl adipate in corn oil for 2 weeks prior to mating\nwith undosed males, throughout mating, and until day 7 of\ngestation.125The dams were killed on day 14 of gestation. All\nanimals survived until study termination. Body weights and\nbody weight gains were significantly decreased in the 2000\nmg/kg bw dose group prior to mating. Staining around the\nperineum was observed in the 1000 and 2000 mg/kg bw dose\ngroups. No statistically significant differences were observed\nfor the 200 mg/kg bw group compared to controls. The mean\nestrous cycle length was statistic ally significantly increased in\nthe 1000 and 2000 mg/kg bw groups, and the post-\nimplantation loss rate was als o statistically significantly\nincreased in these groups. A dditionally, in the 2000 mg/kg\nbw group, there was a significant decrease in implantation\nrate, and the number of live emb ryos was statistically signif-\nicantly decreased and the pre-i mplantation loss rate statisti-\ncally significantly increased. Th e researchers stated that the\neffects observed in this ferti lity study, in conjunction with the\novarian effects described earl ier in the repeated dose study,\nsuggest that diethylhexyl adipate disturbed ovulation. This\ncorrelated with the effect on estrous cycle length.\nThe testicular toxicity of diethylhexyl adipate was examined\nusing male F344 rats.163Groups of 6 rats were fed a diet con-\ntaining 6000 or 25 000 ppm diethylhexyl adipate for 4 weeks,\nand the controls were given untreated feed. Some groups were\ndosed ip with 200 mg/kg bw thioacetamide, 3x/week for 4\nweeks, and prior to dosing with diethylhexyl adipate to evalu-\nate whether liver disease enhanced testicular effects. (There\nwas a 1-week rest period prior to dosing with diethylhexyl\nadipate.) The final bws of animals given 25 000 ppm diethyl-\nhexyl adipate, with and without prior administration of thioa-\ncetamide, were statistically significantly decreased compared\nto their respective controls. The relative liver to bws of these\nanimals were statistically significantly increased. No signifi-\ncant effect on the relative weights of the testes or epididymis\nwas seen for any of the test groups. Diethylhexyl adipate did\nnot have any testicular toxic effects, with or without the induc-\ntion of hepatic damage.\nDiisononyl Adipate. In a subchronic dietary study described\nearlier, groups of male and female Beagle dogs were fed 0, 0.3,\n1.0, or 3.0 %(weeks 1-8) and 6.0 %(weeks 9-13) diisononyl\nadipate for 13 weeks.92Reproductive tissues were evaluated.\nNo significant findings were reported for the 0.3 %and 1.0%\ngroups. In the high-dose group, testes weight was decreased. AtBergfeld et al 59Smicroscopic examination, it was found that the epididymal\nducts were devoid of spermatoz oa, the seminiferous tubules\nwere composed of Sertoli cells and spermatogonia, sperma-\ntocytes and spermatids were not evident, and there was almost\ntotal aspermatogenesis. Ovaries were not weighed at\nnecropsy. There were no gross or microscopic changes in the\novaries of the high-dose group compared to controls.\nDibutyl Sebacate. A test group of 20 male and 20 female\nSprague-Dawley rats was fed a diet containing 6.25 %dibutyl\nsebacate for 10 weeks, while a control group of 12 male and 12\nfemale rats were fed the basal diet, and then animals of each\ngroup were then mated.122The dams were allowed to deliver\ntheir litters, and at weaning, 24 male and 24 female offspring\nwere randomly chosen, fed the test diet for 21 days, and then\nkilled for necropsy. The study results indicated that ingestion of\na diet containing 6.25 %dibutyl sebacate had no adverse effect\non fertility, litter size, or survival of offspring. Growth was\ndecreased during the pre-weaning and post-weaning periods.\nHowever, no gross pathological changes were found among\nyoung rats killed at the end of the 21-day post-weaning period.\nDiethylhexyl Sebacate. Reproduction, suckling and growth\nwere normal in a 4-generation study of rats fed a diet contain-\ning 200 ppm diethylhexyl sebacate ( *10 mg/kg bw/d).1No\nreproductive or developmental toxicity was observed.\nDimethyl Glutarate/Dimethyl Succinate/Dimethyl Adipate\nMixture. The developmental toxicity produced by the inhalation\nof dibasic esters (mixture of 65.1 %dimethyl glutarate, 17.8 %\ndimethyl succinate, and 16.8 %dimethyl adipate) was evalu-\nated in rats.164Groups of 24 gravid Crl:CD rats were exposed\nfor 6 hours/d to 0, 0.16, 0.4, or 1.0 mg/L dibasic esters, by\nwhole body inhalation, on days 7 to 16 of gestation. The aero-\nsol particle size in the 1.0 mg/L chamber was 5.3 to 5.4 mm,\nwith 72 %to 74%of the aerosol <10 mm. The animals were\nkilled on day 21 of gestation. All animals survived until study\ntermination. Body weight gains were statistically significantly\ndecreased in the 0.4 and 1.0 mg/L groups. Feed consumption by\nthese groups was reduced during the first 6 exposures; statisti-\ncal significance was not given. Statistically significant differ-\nences in absolute and relative liver to bws were not observed,\nbut there was a significant trend of decreased absolute, but not\nrelative, liver weights. The onl y significant clinical signs\nobserved were perinasal staining and wet fur of rats in the\n1.0 mg/L group. Reproductive and developmental effects were\nnot observed, and the dibasic esters mixture was not a devel-\nopmental toxicant in rats following inhalation of /C201.0 mg/L.\nGroups of 20 Crl:CD(SD)BR rats/gender were exposed for 6\nhours/d, 5 days/week, to 0, 0.16, 0.40, or 1.0 mg/L dibasic\nesters by whole body inhalation for 14 weeks prior to mating,\nand then 7 days/week for 8 weeks of mating, gestation, and\nlactation.165The mean aerosol particle size in the 1.0 mg/L\nchamber was 6.2 mm, with 69 %of the aerosol <10 mm. Expo-\nsure was discontinued from day 19 of gestation through day 3\npost-partum. All parental rats and 10 pups/gender were killedand necropsied on day 21 post-partum. The remaining pups\nwere not necropsied. Maternal bws in the 0.40 mg/L group\nwere decreased during the last week of the study, while bws\nof male and female rats of the 1.0 mg/L group were slightly\ndecreased from week 7 on. Relative liver to bws were slightly,\nbut not significantly, decreased in the 0.4 and 1.0 mg/L groups.\nOther differences in organ weights were not considered dose-\nrelated. With the exception of a statistically significant\ndecrease in pup bws at birth and day 21, no reproductive or\ndevelopmental effects were observed. The only microscopic\nfindings were squamous metaplasia in the olfactory epithelium\nof all treated parental rats. This effect was minimal in the 0.16\nmg/L group and mild to moderate in the 0.4 and 1.0 mg/mL\ngroups. The NOEL for reproductive parameters was 1.0 mg/L.\nEndocrine Disruption\nDiethylhexyl adipate. A 28-day repeated-dose toxicity study\nwas performed based on the Enhanced OEDC Test Guideline\nno. 407 (enhanced TG 407) to determine whether diethylhexyl\nadipate has endocrine-mediated activities.166Groups of 10\nmale and 10 female Crj:CD (SD) rats were dosed orally by\ngavage with 0, 40, 200, or 1000 mg/kg bw diethylhexyl adipate\nin corn oil, at a volume of 10 mL/kg, for a minimum of 28 days.\nIn addition to clinical observations, a functional observation\nbattery was performed during week 4, estrous cycling was\nassessed from day 22, hormone analysis was measured at the\nend of the test period, and sperm morphology and sperm count\nwere examined. Male animals were killed and necropsied on\nday 29, while females were killed and necropsied on days 30 to\n34 when in diestrous. Signs of toxicity were not observed, and\nno clinical chemistry or hematological findings were recorded.\nHormonal and spermatological analyses were normal. Statisti-\ncally significant increases were seen in relative kidney to bws\nin males of the 200 and 1000 mg/kg bw groups, relative liver to\nbws of males in the 1000 mg/kg bw group, and in relative liver,\nkidney, and adrenal to bws in females of the 1000 mg/kg bw\ngroup. Microscopically, increased eosinophilic bodies and hya-\nline droplets were seen in the kidneys of male rats of the 1000\nmg/kg bw group. Ovarian follicle atresia was observed in 4\nfemales of the 1000 mg/kg bw group, accompanied by a pro-\nlonged estrous cycle in 2 of these rats. A change in the estrous\ncycle is an important endpoint for determination of endocrine-\nmediated effects in the enhanced TG 407 assay. The research-\ners stated that this effect, in conjunction with the microscopic\nfindings, appears to be related to endocrine-mediated effects of\ndiethylhexyl adipate. However, it was also stated that these\nfindings may be attributable to the disturbance of ovarian func-\ntion according to the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonad axis. The\nchanges in relative kidney to bws and liver to bws, and accom-\npanying histopathological cha nges, were considered toxic\neffects, and these findings indicated that the NOEL was 40\nmg/kg bw/d.\nThe effect diethylhexyl adipate. at concentrations of 1 /C2\n10/C010to 5/C210/C05mol/L, on estrogen receptor and thyroid\nhormone (TH) functions was also examined.167The TH-like60S International Journal of Toxicology 31(Supplement 1)activity was assessed using the rat pituitary tumor cell line GH3\nexpressing intracellular TH and estrogen receptors and\nresponding to physiological concentration of TH by prolifera-\ntion. At ‘‘low potency’’, diethylhexyl adipate stimulated the\nTH- dependent rat pituitary GH3 cell proliferation in a\nconcentration-dependent manner. (The lowest tested concen-\ntration at which a statistically significant effect was detected\nwas 10/C05mol/L.) Cotreatment of GH3 cells with diethylhexyl\nadipate potentiated the L-3,5,30-triiodothyronine (T3)-EC 50\npotentiated the T3-induced GH3 cell proliferation.\nGenotoxicity\nDetails of the genotoxicity studies on esters of dicarboxylic\nacids and esterase metabolites are described in Table 17.\nDiethyl Malonate. Diethyl malonate was not mutagenic in an\nAmes test or a cytogenetic assay using human peripheral lym-\nphocytes at concentrations /C205000mg/plate.39\nDimethyl Malonate. Dimethyl malonate was not mutagenic in\nan Ames test at concentrations /C205000mg/plate.39\nDimethyl Succinate. Dimethyl succinate was not mutagenic in\nan Ames tests with concentrations of /C2020 000 mg/plate168or in\na preincubation assay with concentrations of /C2010 000 mg/\nplate.169\nDimethyl Glutarate. Dimethyl glutarate was not mutagenic in\na preincubation assay with concentrations of /C2010 000 mg/\nplate.170\nDimethyl Adipate. Dimethyl adipate was not mutagenic in a\npreincubation assay w ith concentrations of /C2010 000 mg/\nplate.171\nDibutyl Adipate. Dibutyl adipate was mutagenic in an Ames\ntest at concentrations of /C205000mg/plate. It was not genotoxic\nin an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay in which the animals\nwere dosed with /C202000 mg/kg bw.5\nDi-C7-9 Branched and Linear Alkyl Esters of Adipic Acid. Di-C7-9\nbranched and linear alkyl esters of adipic acid were not muta-\ngenic in an Ames test at concentrations of /C2010.0ml/plate.92\nDitridecyl Adipate. Ditridecyl adipate was not mutagenic in\nan Ames test at concentrations of 0 to 10 mL/plate, and it\nwas not clastogenic in an in vivo micronucleus assay using\nrats dosed dermally with 0, 800, or 2000 mg/kg bw ditride-\ncyl adipate.92\nDiethylhexyl Adipate. Diethylhexyl adipate was not mutagenic\nin an Ames (concentrations tested were not provided) test.2\nDiethylhexyl adipate was not mutagenic in a number of\ngenotoxicity studies. In vitro, negative results were reported\nin Ames tests at concentrations ranging from /C20150 to 10 000\nmg/plate,92,173-175in an NTP preincubation assay,176in a liquid\nsuspension assay,177and in a forward mutation assay usingL5178Y cells at concentrations /C201000mg/mL.180In an assay\nfor sister chromatid exchanges and chromosomal aberrations\nusing concentrations of /C20200mg/plate, results were nega-\ntive,179while in another assay with /C20400ml/plate, results were\nnegative without, but equivoca l with, metabolic activation\nin the sister chromatid exchange assay and there was some\nevidence of genotoxicity without, but none with, metabolic\nactivation in the chromosomal aberration assay.178In a\n3H-thymidine assay, there was a dose-dependent inhibition of\n3H-thymidine incorporation into replicating DNA, with a dose-\ndependent increase in the ratio of acid-soluble DNA-\nincorporated3H-thymidine.174In vivo, results were negative\nin micronucleus tests92,190and chromosomal aberration\nassays.191,192\nAn Ames test was performed on urine of rats dosed with\ndiethylhexyl adipate to assess whether mutagenic substances\noccur in the urine following diethylhexyl adipate adminstra-\ntion.181Groups of /C216 male Sprague-Dawley rats were dosed\norally by gavage with 0 or 2000 mg/kg bw diethylhexyl adipate\nin corn oil for 15 days. Urine was collected daily. The urine was\nnot mutagenic in the Ames test, indicating that diethylhexyl\nadipate is not converted to mutagenic urinary metabolites. The\nurine of rats dosed with 1000 mg/kg bw 2-ethylhexanol by\ngavage for 15 days was also tested in an Ames assay. The urine\nof these rats also was not mutagenic. Urine from rats that were\ndosed with a known mutagen gave a positive response in an\nAmes test.\nDiisononyl Adipate. Diisononyl adipate was not mutagenic in\nan Ames assay at /C201000mg/plate, and it was not genotoxic in a\nmouse lymphoma assay, a transformation assay, or a BALB/\n3t3 assay at concentrations of /C20100, 1000, or 1.3 mg/mL,\nrespectively.182\nDiethyl Sebacate.

A single 10 mg dose of diethyl-\nhexyl adipate given by sc injection was not carcinogenic in mice.\nIn a lifetime study, diethylhexyl adipate caused no skin tumors\nwhen 10 mg was applied weekly to the back skin of mice.2\nResearch has shown that other compounds with a 2-\nethylhexyl group that have been evaluated for carcinogenicity\nhad some evidence of hepatocarcinogenicity, ranging from\nvery strong to equivocal, in rodents.194\nIn an evaluation of the carcinogenic risk of diethylhexyl adi-\npate, the IARC stated that there was limited evidence in experi-\nmental animals for the carcinogenicity of diethylhexyl adipate.17\nTherefore, the overall evaluation of diethylhexyl adipate was not\nclassifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans (Group 3).\nDiethylhexyl Sebacate. No evidence of carcinogenicity was\nobserved in an unspecified number of rats fed a diet providing\nabout 10 mg diethylhexyl sebacate/kg/d for up to 19 months.1\nNo further study details were provided.\nTumor Promotion\nDiethylhexyl adipate. A group of 14 male F344 rats were used\nto assess the carcinogenic potential of diethylhexyl adipate in a\nmedium-term liver bioassay.195The rats were given a single ip\ndose of diethylnitrosamine, and 2 weeks later they were given\n20 000 ppm diethylhexyl adipate in the diet. At week 3, a\npartial hepatectomy was performed. Positive results for carci-\nnogenic potential were indicated by a significant increase in\nGST-P positive foci. Diethylhexyl adipate did not have an\nenhancing effect on the development of GST-P-positive foci.\nRisk Assessment\nDiethylhexyl adipate. According to the Integrated Risk Infor-\nmation System of the EPA, the weight-of-evidence classifica-\ntion for diethylhexyl adipate was ‘‘possible human\ncarcinogen’’.161The classification was based on an absence\nof human data and increased liver tumors in female mice. The\nonly genotoxic effect was a positive dominant lethal assay. It\nwas noted that diethylhexyl adipate exhibits structural relation-\nships to other nongenotoxic compounds that are classified as\nprobable and possible carcinogens.\nSummary\nThis safety assessment includes sebacic acid and other alkyl\na,o-dicarboxylic acids, salts, monoesters and diesters, for a\ntotal of 56 ingredients. The dicarboxylic acids are terminally\nfunctionalized straight alkyl chains characterized by a separa-\ntion between the acid functional groups of 1 to 10 carbons. The\nsimple alkyl di-esters are the result of the condensation of\nalkyl dicarboxylic acids and 2 equivalents of alkyl alcohols.\nThese ingredients can be metabolized via hydrolysis back to\nthe parent alcohol, the mono-ester, and the parent dicar-\nboxylic acid. The simple alkyl esters (mono- and di-) of thesedicarboxylic acids have straight or branched side chains rang-\ning in length from 1 to 18 carbons. This safety assessment is\ndivided into 2 parts—(1) 12 dicar boxylic acids and their salts\nand (2) 44 esters of dicarboxylic acids.\nA safety assessment of diethylhexyl adipate (called dioctyl\nadipate at the time of that assessment) and diisopropyl adipate\nwas published in 1984 with the conclusion that these ingredi-\nents are safe as used in cosmetics. This conclusion was reaf-\nfirmed in 2006. Additionally, dibutyl adipate was previously\nreviewed in 1996 and the available data were found insufficient\nto support the safety of dibutyl adipate in cosmetic formula-\ntions. When re-reviewed in 2006, additional data were made\navailable to address the needs identified by the CIR Expert\nPanel, and an amended conclusion was issued stating that dibu-\ntyl adipate is safe for use in cosmetic formulations.\nWhile many of the alkyl dicarboxylic acids occur in natural\nproducts, commercial production of these acids has historically\noccurred via alkali pyrolysis of lipids.\nA relationship exists between the molecular weight and the\nlog octanol—water partioning coefficient. Physical properties\nchange as chain length increases, and the water solubility of\nthese acids is inversely proportional to their chain length. Odd\nversus even chain length also plays a role. The alternating\neffects are believed to be the result of the inability of odd\ncarbon number compounds to assume an in-plane orientation\nof both carboxyl groups with respect to the hydrocarbon chain.\nThe diesters, in contrast, are much more lipid soluble and more\ndifficult to dissolve in water. The short-chain alkyl mono- and\ndiesters are more soluble in water, less lipophilic, and relatively\nmore volatile than the corresponding longer chain alkyl esters.\nThe ingredients included in this review would not be\nexpected to have any meaningful UV absorption.\nThe ingredients in this report function in cosmetics as pH-\nadjusters, fragrance ingredients, plasticizers, skin-conditioning\nagents and/or solvents and corrosion inhibitors. The majority of\nthe dicarboxylic acids function in cosmetics as pH adjusters or\nfragrance ingredients. Six of the 12 dicarboxylic acids and their\nsalts and 24 of the 44 esters included in this safety assessment\nare reported to be used in cosmetic formulations. For the dicar-\nboxylic acids and their salts, disodium succinate has the great-\nest number of reported uses, with a total of 45. The acid with\nthe greatest concentration of use is succinic acid, 26 %; use at\nthis concentration is in a bath product that will be diluted\nduring use. The greatest leave-on concentration is 0.4 %, dis-\nodium succinate, with dermal contact exposure. For the esters,\ndiisopropyl adipate has the greatest number of uses, with 70\nreported. The concentration of use is greatest for dimethyl\nglutarate, 15 %in a dermal rinse-off product. The ingredients\nwith the greatest leave-on use concentrations, which are all\ndermal contact exposures, are diethylhexyl adipate, 14 %, dii-\nsostearyl adipate, 10 %, and diisopropyl sebacate, 10 %.\nDicarboxylic Acids and Their Salts\nDicarboxylic acids are endogenous metabolic products of the\no-oxidation of monocarboxylic acids when the b-oxidation ofBergfeld et al 65Sfree fatty acids is impaired. Under normal physiological con-\nditions, dicarboxylic acids are rapidly b-oxidized, resulting in\nvery low cellular concentrations and practically nondetectable\nconcentrations in the plasma. Oxidation of odd- and even-\nnumbered chains proceeds to different end points; even chains\nare completely, while odd-number chains are not completely,\noxidized.\nUnchanged dicarboxylic acid was found in the urine of rats.\nWith oral dosing, approximately 53 %to 67%adipic acid, 40 %\nazelaic acid, and 50 %dodecanedioate was recovered with the\nrespective acid. With iv dosing, 59 %to 71%adipic acid and\n35%sebacate was recovered. In humans, 6.76 to 61 adipic acid,\nand 61%azelaic acid were found in the urine after dosing with\nthe respective acid. With azelaic acid and dodecanedioic acid,\nradioactivity was found in all tissues, and it decreased after 24\nhours in all tissues except adipose tissue. Radioactivity was\nfound in expired carbon dioxide at 24 hours after dosing adipic\nacid (70 %), azelaic acid (14.5 %), and disodium sebacate\n(25%). For rats dosed orally with azelaic, sebacic, undecane-\ndioic, and dodecanedioic acid, 2.5, 2.1, 1.8, and 1.6 %of the\nrespective acid was found in the urine unchanged. The amount\nrecovered decreased with increasing chain length. After oral\ndosing, 60, 17, 5, and 0.1 %of azelaic, sebacic, decanedioic, and\nundecanedioic acids, respectively, were recovered unchanged in\nthe urine. In the plasma of both animals and humans, dicar-\nboxylic acid catabolites that were 2-, 4-, or 6- carbons shorter\nthan the corresponding dicarboxylic acid were found.\nAdipic acid did not induce peroxisome proliferation. Dicar-\nboxylic acids did have some cellular effects and inhibited mito-\nchondrial oxidoreductases, reversibly inhibited microsomal\nNADPH and cytochrome P450 reductase, and competitively\ninhibited tyrosinase in vitro.\nThe oral LD 50values of the dicarboxylic acids had a wide\nrange; for example, adipic acid had values in rats ranging from\n0.94 g/kg to greater than the highest dose tested (11 g/kg). Most\nreported values for the acids were >2 g/kg. The reported dermal\nLD50values ranged from >6 g/kg dodecanedioic acid to >10 g/\nkg glutaric acid.\nIn short-term oral toxicity studies, /C203000 mg/kg bw/d adi-\npic acid did not produce significant toxicological effects in rats.\nSigns of toxicity were seen at >3600 mg/kg bw/d. No toxicity\nwas observed with guinea pigs fed 400 to 600 mg/d adipic acid.\nShort-term inhalation exposure to 126 mg/m3adipic acid to rats\ndid not produce signs of toxicity, but exposure of mice to 460\nmg/m3resulted in decreased weight gain and produced effects\nin the upper respiratory tract, liver, kidneys, and central ner-\nvous system.\nIn a subchronic oral study, 10 male and 10 female rats\nexposed to 10 %sodium succinate in the drinking water died,\nbut no compound-related lesions were found. Body weights\nwere decreased in rats given /C212.5%sodium succinate for 13\nweeks, but toxicological treatment-related changes were not\nobserved. Glutaric acid had a low degree of toxicity to rats\n(at 2%) and dogs (concentration not specified) when given in\nthe feed. Dietary administration of /C203400 mg/kg bw/d adipic\nacid for 19 weeks produced slight effects in the liver of malerats; the NOAEL was 3333 mg/kg bw. A mixture of adipic,\nglutaric, and succinic acids had a low degree of toxicity in rats\nwhen tested at 3 %for 90-days. Signs of toxicity were reported\nin a subchronic inhalation study in which mice were exposed to\n13 or 120 mg/m3adipic acid.\nSlight effects were seen in the livers of rats fed /C203200 mg/\nkg bw/d adipic acid for 33 weeks, and the NOAEL for rats fed a\ndiet containing adipic acid for 2 years was 1 %; no significant\ntoxicological effects were seen at concentrations of /C205%.N o\nsignificant toxicological effects were observed for mice fed\n/C20280 mg/kg bw or rabbits fed /C20400 mg/kg bw azelaic acid\nfor 180 days. Disodium sebacate was not toxic to rats or rabbits\nfed up to 1000 mg/kg bw for 6 mos.\nFor the dicarboxylic acids, the severity of ocular irritation\nseems to decrease with increasing carbon number. Succinic\nacid was a severe ocular irritant, glutaric acid was moderately\nirritating, and dodecanedioic acid was a slight irritant. Ocular\nirritation produced by adipic acid was dose-dependent. Slight\nto mild dermal irritation was observed in rabbits for succinic,\nglutaric, and adipic acid, while dodecanedioic acid was not an\nirritant in rabbits. Using guinea pigs, adipic acid, dodecane-\ndioic acid, and a mixture of succinic, glutaric, and adipic acids\nare not sensitizers.\nReproductive and developmental effects were not seen upon\noral dosing with the dicarboxylic acids or disodium sebacate.\nMalonic acid, at 0.1 %in vitro, has a spermicidal effect on\nhuman spermatozoa. Glutaric acid was tested at doses of\n/C201300 mg/kg bw in rats and 500 mg/kg bw in rabbits, adipic\nacid at doses of /C20263 mg/kg bw in mice, 288 mg/kg bw in rats,\n205 mg/kg bw in hamsters, or 250 mg/kg bw in rabbits, azelaic\nacid at doses of /C20140 mg/kg bw in rats and 200 mg/kg bw in\nrabbits, disodium sebacate at 500 mg/kg bw in rats and 1000\nmg/kg bw in rabbits, and dode canedioic acid was tested at\n/C201000 mg/kg bw using rats. Embryotoxic effects were\nreported in a reproductive study of 2500 mg/kg bw/d azelaic\nacid using rats and in reproductive studies with /C20500 mg/kg\nbw/d azelaic acid using rabbits and monkey. In vitro, sodium\nsalts of some dicarboxylic acid had a specific inhibitory effect\non muscle activity of the uterine horn, and this effect progres-\nsively increased with chain length.\nThe dicarboxylic acids are not genotoxic, and consistently\nwere not mutagenic in Ames tests. Positive results were seen in\na transformation assay on glutaric acid using Balb/c-3T3 cells,\nboth with and without metabolic activation. The results of a\nmouse lymphoma assay, with and without metabolic activa-\ntion, on glutaric acid were negative in a neutral pH range.\nEquivocal results were obtained in an in vitro chromosomal\naberration assay of /C2015 mg/mL disodium succinate using Chi-\nnese hamster fibroblast cells. The dicarboxylic acids were not\ngenotoxic in in vivo assays.\nCarcinogenicity was not seen in rats given up to 2 %sodium\nsuccinate in the drinking water or 5 %adipic acid in feed for 2\nyears. An increase in the incidence of C-cell adenoma/carci-\nnoma of the thyroid in females given 2 %sodium succinate, and\na positive trend in the occurrence of this tumor, was considered\na function of experimental variability and not related to dosing.66S International Journal of Toxicology 31(Supplement 1)Adipic acid was not carcinogenic when given orally to rats at\nup to 5%in the diet.\nIn a cumulative irritancy test, the cumulative irritation of a\n15%azelaic acid gel increased with successive patching. It is\nnot known if the vehicle played a role in the irritation scores.\nDaily application of a 20 %azelaic cream causes erythema and\nirritation.\nEsters of Dicarboxylic Acids\nThe metabolism of diesters in animals is expected to occur,\ninitially, via enzymatic hydrolysis, leading to the correspond-\ning dicarboxylic acids and the corresponding linear or branched\nalcohol. These dicarboxylic acids and alcohols can be further\nmetabolized or conjugated to polar products that are excreted in\nurine, or, the enzymatic hydrolysis may be incomplete and\nresult, at least for some diesters, in the production of\nmonoesters.\nIn in vitro absorption studies using pig skin, 8.8 %and 3%of\nundiluted diethyl malonate were found in the skin and receptor\nfluid, respectively, after 50 hours. Absorption was enhanced\nwhen diethyl malonate was diluted with ethanol and reduced\nwhen diluted in acetone. Using human skin, 16 %of the applied\ndiethyl malonate penetrated in 24 hours. In vivo, absorption of\ndiethyl malonate, estimated from urinary and fecal recovery, was\n15%in nude mice, 4 %in human skin grafted to nude mice, 6 %\nin pig skin grafted to nude mice, 2.5 %in pigs, and 4 %in dogs.\nApproximately 11 %of ditridecyl adipate was absorbed\nthrough the skin of rats; 5.5 %to 7.4%of the applied dose was\nfound in the tissues, 3.5 %to 4.7%was found in the urine, and\n0.4%to 0.7%was found in the feces after 4 days. Prior dosing\nwith ditridecyl adipate did not significantly affect absorption.\nIn vitro, diethylhexyl adipate was readily hydrolyzed to\nmono-(2-ethylhexyl) adipate (MEHA) or adipic acid in rat liver,\npancreas, and small intestine tissue preparations. In rats, diethyl-\nhexyl adipate is hydrolyzed to adipic acid and 2-ethylhexanol or\nMEHA. 2-Ethylhexanol is converted to 2-ethylhexanoic acid,\nwhich may form a glucuronide conjugate or may be subjected\ntoo-a n d( o-1)-oxidation and further metabolism. More than\n98%of diethylhexyl adipate administered orally to rats was\nexcreted in 48 hours; 21 %to 45%of the radioactivity was\nexpired in carbon dioxide and 34 %to 52%was excreted in the\nurine. Diethylhexyl adipate and MEHA are not found in the\nblood or urine; diethylhexyl adipate or the metabolites are recov-\nered in the tissues. Metabolism studies have shown that excre-\ntion in the urine is not as unchanged diethylhexyl adipate; mostly\nadipic acid is found. In humans, peak urinary elimination of all\nmetabolites occurred within 8 hours of dosing.\nDiethylhexyl sebacate is not readily absorbed through the\nskin of guinea pigs. Metabolism in rodents and humans may\nfollow partially common pathways, producing 2-ethylhexanol\nas an intermediary metabolite.\nDiethylhexyl adipate is a peroxisome proliferator requiring\nextensive phase I metabolism to produce the proximate peroxi-\nsome proliferator, which in both mice and rats appears to be 2-\nethylhexanoic acid. Diethylhexyl adipate is not as potent aproliferator as diethylhexyl phthalate. Peroxisome proliferation\ncauses an increase in liver weights and can induce hepatocar-\ncinogenicity in rats and mice. Peroxisome proliferation is not\nbelieved to pose the risk of inducing hepatocarcinogenesis in\nhumans, as a species differenc e in response to peroxisome\nproliferators exists.\nDiethylhexyl adipate did not bind covalently to hepatic\nDNA in mice. It did stimulate DNA synthesis in livers of rats.\nIn another study, a statistically significant increase in 8-OH-dG\noccurred in the liver DNA, but not the kidney DNA, at week 1\nand 2. The IARC remarked that the weight of evidence for\ndiethylhexyl adipate demonstrated that rodent peroxisome pro-\nliferators do not act as direct DNA-damaging agents.\nThe oral and dermal LD 50values are greater than 2 g/kg. No\nmortality occurred in rats exposed to concentrated vapors of\ndiethyl malonate diethyl succina te, dibutyl adipate, or diethyl-\nhexyl adipate for 8 hours. Some deaths, possibly due to ther-\nmal decomposition were seen in rats and rabbits exposed to\n940 mg/m3 for 7 hours. In a 4-hr inhalation toxicity study, a\nmixture of dimethyl glutarate, dimethyl succinate, and\nmethyl adipate, the anterior and posterior nasal passageways\nwere affected.\nOral administration of /C201000 mg/kg bw dibutyl adipate for\n28 days did not produce toxic effects in rats. In short-term oral\ndosing with diethylhexyl adipate, decreased weight gain was\nreported for rats and mice. The NOELs for rats and mice were\n2 and 0.63 %, respectively, in feed; 5/5 female mice fed 10 %\ndibutyl adipate in feed died. In 2- and 4-week studies of\ndiethylhexyl adipate, the or al NOAEL for ovarian toxicity\nwas 200 mg/kg bw in rats; an increase in atresia of the large\nfollicle and a decrease in currently formed corpora lutea were\nseen in females dosed with 1000 and 2000 mg/kg bw diethyl-\nhexyl adipate.\nIn a short-term dermal study in which 10 rabbits were dosed\ndermally with 0.5 or 1.0 mL/kg of a 20 %dispersion of dibutyl\nadipate for 6 weeks, there was a significant decrease in bws in\nthe high-dose group, and renal lesions in 1 animal of each\ngroup. There were no signs of toxicity in guinea pigs in an\nimmersion study with 20.75 %diisopropyl adipate, diluted to\nan actual concentration of 0.10 %adipate. Dermal administra-\ntion of diethylhexyl adipate to rabbits for 2 weeks resulted in\nslight to moderate erythema at the test site, but toxic effects\nwere not reported for most of the animals.\nIn a 90-day oral toxicity study in which rats were fed 36 to\n41 mg/kg bw diethyl malonate, no treatment-related effects\nwere observed. Dietary administration of /C202.5%di-C7-9\nbranched and linear alkyl esters of adipic (approx. 1500 and\n1900 mg/kg bw/d for males and females, respectively) for 90\ndays did not result in systemic toxicity. The NOAELS for male\nand female rats were 1500 and 1950 mg/kg bw/d, respectively.\nSubchronic oral administration of diethylhexyl adipate to rats\ncaused significant decreases in bw gains and increases in liver\nand kidney weights. The dietary NOEL for rats in a 90-day\nstudy was 610 mg/kg bw. A decrease in bws was seen in mice\nfed a diet with 1.2 and 2.5 %diethylhexyl adipate. For diisono-\nnyl adipate, dietary administration of up to 500 mg/kg bw toBergfeld et al 67Srats for 13 weeks resulted in a statistically significant increase\nin relative kidney weights, but there were no toxicological\nfindings. With dogs, 3.0 %dietary diisononyl adipate resulted\nin a decrease in bws, testes weight, and feed consumption,\nincreased liver weight, elevated enzyme levels, liver and kid-\nney discoloration, and microscopic changes in the liver, testes,\nspleen, and kidneys.\nNo adverse effects were reported with whole-body applica-\ntion of a 6.25 %emulsion of dibutyl adipate to dogs 2x/week for\n3 mos. Unoccluded dermal application of up to 2000 mg/kg bw\nditridecyl adipate for 13 weeks to rats produced slight\nerythema, but no systemic toxicity.\nIn a 6-month study in which rats were dosed intragastrically\nwith diethylhexyl adipate, he patic detoxification appeared\ndepressed at the beginning of the study, while in a 10-mos\nstudy, a decrease in central nervous system excitability was\nnoted. Dietary administration of /C201.25%dibutyl sebacate for\n1 year or /C206.25%for 2 years did not have an effect on growth\nOcular irritation appeared to lessen in severity as chain\nlength of the dicarboxylic acid esters increased. Undiluted\ndiethyl malonate was slightly to moderately irritating to rabbit\neyes. Dibutyl, diisopropyl, and diethylhexyl adipate, at concen-\ntrations ranging from 0.1 %to 100%,w e r en o n -o rm i n i m a l\nocular irritants. Diisopropyl sebacate was minimally irritating.\nDiethylhexyl sebacate was nonirritating in an MTT viability\nassay. Undiluted dioctyldodecyl and diisocetyl dodecanedioate\nwere not irritating to rabbit eyes.\nThe esters of dicarboxylic acids were mostly non- or mildly\nirritating to rabbit skin. Some minimal irritation was seen with\ndiisopropyl adipate, undiluted or at 5 to 20; 75 %in formula-\ntion, and moderate erythema was reported with undiluted dibu-\ntyl adipate. Dimethyl malona te, dibutyl and diethylhexyl\nadipate, diethylhexyl sebacate, and dioctyldodecyl dodecane-\ndioate were not sensitizers in guinea pigs or rabbits. Perfume\nformulations containing 1.1 %diisopropyl adipate were not\nphototoxic in rabbits.\nOral administration of up to 1000 mg/kg bw dimethyl mal-\nonate to Wistar rats did not have an effect on fertility, and no\ndevelopmental toxicity was reported. The NOAEL was 300\nmg/kg bw for repeated dose and maternal toxicity and 1000\nmg/kg bw for fertility and developmental toxicity. Oral admin-\nistration of up to 100 mg/kg bw dibutyl adipate to Sprague-\nDawley rats did not cause any reproductive effects, and the\nNOEL for parental and offspring toxicity was 300 mg/kg bw/\nd and for reproductive toxicity was 100 mg/kg bw/d. Oral\nadministration of /C207000 mg/kg bw di-C7-9 branched and lin-\near alkyl esters of adipic acid to Sprague-Dawley rats did not\nresult in developmental toxicity. Dietary administration of up\nto 1.2%diethylhexyl adipate did not affect fertility when fed to\nrats prior to mating. Fetal weight, total litter weight, and litter\nsize were reduced with 1.2 %diethylhexyl adipate. In a study in\nwhich gravid rats were fed the same doses during gestation, no\nsignificant effects on fetal weight or litter size were reported.\nAn increased incidence of minor skeletal abnormalities was\nattributed to fetotoxicity. In a study in which diethylhexyl adi-\npate was given orally to rats from day 7 of gestation until post-natal day 17, antiandrogenic effects were not observed,\nalthough some increase in post-natal death was observed.\nAdministration of up to 2000 mg/kg bw diethylhexyl adipate\nprior to dosing and through day 7 of gestation did have an effect\non the mean estrous cycle length at a dose of 1000 and 2000\nmg/kg bw, and did appear to disturb ovulation. Significant\ndecreases were also seen in implantation rate and number of\nlive embryos, as well as an increase in pre-implantation loss.\nDiethylhexyl adipate did not produce testicular toxic effects in\nmale F344 rats when fed at up to 25 000 ppm in the diet for 4\nweeks. Dietary administration of 6.25 %dibutyl sebacate to\nmale and female Sprague-Dawley rats for 10 weeks prior to\nmating had no adverse effects on fertility, litter size, or survival\nof offspring. Diethylhexyl sebacate, 200 ppm in the diet, did\nnot produce reproductive or developmental effects in rats.\nDermal applications of 2000 mg/kg bw ditridecyl adipate\ndid not have an effect on sperm morphology. Some visceral\nanomalies were reported. The NOAELs for maternal toxicity\nand developmental and reproductive effects were 2000 and\n800 mg/kg bw/d, respectively.\nDimethyl, diethyl, dipropyl, dibutyl, diisobutyl, and diethyl-\nhexyl adipate were evaluated for fetotoxic and teratogenic\neffects in rats when administered ip at 1/3 to 1/30 of the ip\nLD50values. Some effect on resorptions and abnormalities\nwere seen with all but diethyl adipate.\nInhalation by rats of /C201.0 mg/L of a mixture of dimethyl\nglutarate, dimethyl succinate, and dimethyl adipate on days 7 to\n16 of gestation or for 14 days prior to mating, during mating\nand gestation, and lactation, no adverse developmental or\nreproductive effects were observed. The only exception was\na statistically significant decrease in pup weight at birth and\nday 21.\nDiethylhexyl adipate appeared to have endocrine-mediated\neffects in Crj:CD (SD) rats in a 28-day oral study; however, it\nwas stated that the findings may be attributable to the distur-\nbance in ovarian function according to the hypothalamic-\npituitary-gonad axis. Diethylhexyl adipate simulated thyroid\nhormone-dependent rat pituitary GH3 cell proliferation in a\nconcentration-dependent manner.\nThe esters of dicarboxylic acids were not mutagenic or gen-\notoxic in a battery of in vitro and in vivo tests. The only non-\nnegative results reported were e quivocal results in a sister\nchromatid exchange assay with /C20400mg/mL diethylhexyl adi-\npate in the presence of meta bolic activation and a dose-\ndependent inhibition of3H-thymidine into replicating DNA,\nwith a dose-dependent increase in the ratio of acid-\nincorporated3H-thymidine with /C200.01 mol/L diethylhexyl adi-\npate. (The same effect was seen in the3H-thymidine assay with\n2-ethylhexanol.)\nIn an NTP 2-year dietary study, /C2025 000 ppm diethylhexyl\nadipate did not produce tumors in male or female rats, but it did\nincrease the incidence of hepatocellular adenoma and carci-\nnoma in male and female mice. Diethylhexyl adipate did not\ncause skin tumors with weekly application of 10 mg to the back\nof mice in a lifetime study. Other compounds with a 2-\nethylhexyl group that have been evaluated for carcinogenicity68S International Journal of Toxicology 31(Supplement 1)had some evidence of hepatocarcinogenicity, ranging from\nvery strong to equivocal, in rodents. Feeding of diethylhexyl\nsebacate to rats for 19 mos did not result in carcinogenic\neffects.\nIn a number of clinical irritation and sensitization studies,\nthe diesters of dicarboxylic acids are not irritants or sensitizers.\nThe only exception noted was that undiluted diisopropyl adi-\npate was moderately irritating in 1 cumulative irritancy test,\nand some slight irritation was seen with formulations contain-\ning diethylhexyl adipate. A 10 %dilution of dibutyl adipate\ntested on 30 participants and formulations containing 0.7 %to\n17%diisopropyl adipate, tested on 49 to 98 participants, and\n9%diethylhexyl adipate, tested on 25 participants, were not\nphototoxic.\nCases of allergic contact dermatitis in response to diethyl\nsebacate-containing products have been reported, and it has\nbeen demonstrated that diethyl sebacate was the substance, or\none of several substances in the products, eliciting the derma-\ntitis. Two case studies were reported of allergic reactions to\nlotion containing diisopropyl sebacate.\nAccording to the Integrated Risk Information System of the\nEPA, the weight-of-evidence cla ssification for diethylhexyl\nadipate was ‘‘possible human carcinogen’’. The classification\nwas based on an absence of human data and increased liver\ntumors in female mice. The IARC has stated that diethylhexyl\nadipate is not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity in humans.\nDiscussion\nThe Expert Panel reviewed the available data on dicarboxylic\nacids and their salts, and the data on the esters of dicarboxylic\nacids, and determined that these ingredients are safe as used in\ncosmetics. In reaching this conclusion, the Expert Panel con-\nsidered a number of issues.\nThe Expert Panel noted gaps in the available safety data for\nsome of the dicarboxylic acid and salts and esters of dicar-\nboxylic acids in this safety assessment. The available data on\nmany of the ingredients are sufficient, and similar structural\nactivity relationships, biologic functions, and cosmetic product\nusage, suggest that the available data may be extrapolated to\nsupport the safety of the entire group. For example, a concern\nwas expressed regarding the extent of dermal absorption for\ncertain long-chain branched diesters. The Panel inferred that\nsince dermal penetration of long chain alcohols is likely to be\nlow and the dermal penetration for the diesters is likely to be\neven lower, toxicity characteristics from ingredients where\ntoxicity data were available was appropriate.\nThe CIR Expert Panel considered the dangers inherent in\nusing animal-derived ingredients, namely the transmission of\ninfectious agents. While tallow may be used in the manufacture\nof some ingredients in this safety assessment and is clearly\nanimal-derived, the Expert Panel notes that tallow is highly\nprocessed and tallow derivatives even more so. The Panel agrees\nwith determinations by the U.S. FDA that tallow derivatives are\nnot risk materials for transmission of infectious agents.The Panel noted that the only significant toxic effect of the\ndicarboxylic acids was irritation to the skin and eyes, which\nwould be expected for acids. Dicarboxylic acids reviewed in\nthis safety assessment are not expected to be appreciably\nabsorbed from cosmetic formulations, exhibit low single-dose\nor repeated-dose toxicity in animal studies, and are not geno-\ntoxic or carcinogenic in animal studies. Since a use of these\nacids in cosmetics is as a pH adjuster, the irritating property of\nthese acids would be lost. The highest use of an acid in leave-on\nformulations is 0.3 %azelaic acid, of a salt is 0.4 %disodium\nsuccinate, and of an ester is 14 %diethylhexyl adipate.\nAlthough bath products can contain higher concentrations of\nthese acids, salts, or esters, contact time is short and the product\nwill be diluted as it is being rinsed.\nCase studies have reported reactions to products containing\ndiethyl sebacate. Follow-up patch tests performed with /C215%\ndiethyl sebacate, which is greater than the reported use concen-\ntration, had positive results. Diethyl sebacate is reported to be\nused in cosmetics at 1.5 %, and no irritation or sensitization was\nreported in clinical studies of a formulation containing 1.5 %\ndiethyl sebacate.\nThe Expert Panel also noted that esters of dicarboxylic\nacids, in particular diethylhexyl adipate, have the potential to\ninduce peroxisome proliferation. This effect has been exam-\nined because ethylhexyl adipate is structurally related to a\nnotable peroxisome proliferat or, diethylhexyl phthalate.\nDiethylhexyl adipate is not as potent a peroxisome proliferator\nas diethylhexyl phthalate, and, while peroxisome proliferation\nis toxicologically well-studied, this is an effect observed only\nin rodents and is not relevant to humans. Accordingly, the\nhepatocarcinogenic effects observed in rodents are related to\nthis effect and not believed to pose the risk of inducing hepa-\ntocarcinogenesis in humans.\nThe reproductive and developmental toxicity of the dicar-\nboxylic acids and their esters were generally well studied. The\nresults of these studies did not cause any concern for the Panel.\nThe potential adverse effects of inhaled aerosols depend on\nthe specific chemical species, the concentration and the dura-\ntion of the exposure and their site of deposition within the\nrespiratory system. In practice, aerosols should have at least\n99%of their particle diameters in the 10 to 110 mm range and\nthe mean particle diameter in a typical aerosol spray has been\nreported as *38mm. Particles with an aerodynamic diameter\nof/C2010mm are respirable. In the absences of inhalation toxicity\ndata, the panel determined that dicarboxylic acids and their\nsalts and the esters of dicarboxylic acids can be used safely\nin hair sprays, because the product size is not respirable.\nConclusion\nThe CIR Expert Panel concluded that dicarboxylic acids and\ntheir salts, and the esters of dicarboxylic acids, as listed below,\nare safe in the present practices of use and concentration. Were\ningredients in these groups not in current use (as indicated by *)\nto be used in the future, the expectation is that they would beBergfeld et al 69Sused in product categories and at concentrations comparable to\nothers in these groups.\nAcids and salts:\n/C15malonic acid*\n/C15succinic acid\n/C15sodium succinate\n/C15disodium succinate\n/C15glutaric acid*\n/C15adipic acid\n/C15azelaic acid\n/C15dipotassium azelate*\n/C15disodium azelate*\n/C15sebacic acid\n/C15disodium sebacate*\n/C15dodecanedioic acid*\nEsters:\n/C15diethyl malonate\n/C15decyl succinate*\n/C15dimethyl succinate\n/C15diethyl succinate*\n/C15dicapryl succinate\n/C15dicetearyl succinate*\n/C15diisobutyl succinate*\n/C15diethylhexyl succinate\n/C15dimethyl glutarate\n/C15diisobutyl glutarate*\n/C15diisostearyl glutarate\n/C15dimethyl adipate\n/C15diethyl adipate*\n/C15dipropyl adipate*\n/C15dibutyl adipate\n/C15dihexyl adipate\n/C15dicapryl adipate\n/C15di-C12-15 alkyl adipate*\n/C15ditridecyl adipate*\n/C15dicetyl adipate*\n/C15diisopropyl adipate\n/C15diisobutyl adipate\n/C15diethylhexyl adipate\n/C15diisooctyl adipate*\n/C15diisononyl adipate*\n/C15diisodecyl adipate\n/C15dihexyldecyl adipate*\n/C15diheptylundecyl adipate\n/C15dioctyldodecyl adipate\n/C15diisocetyl adipate*\n/C15diisostearyl adipate\n/C15isostearyl sebacate\n/C15diethyl sebacate\n/C15dibutyl sebacate*\n/C15dicaprylyl/capryl sebacate*\n/C15diisopropyl sebacate\n/C15diethylhexyl sebacate\n/C15dibutyloctyl sebacate*/C15diisooctyl sebacate\n/C15dihexyldecyl sebacate*\n/C15dioctyldodecyl sebacate\n/C15diisostearyl sebacate*\n/C15dioctyldodecyl dodecanedioate\n/C15diisocetyl dodecanedioate\nAuthor’s Note\nUnpublished sources cited in this report are available from the Director,\nCosmetic Ingredient Review, 1101 17th St, Suite 412, Washington, DC\n20036, USA.\nDeclaration of Conflicting Interest\nThe author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to\nthe research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.\nFunding\nThe author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for\nthe research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The articles\nin this supplement were sponsored by the Cosmetic Ingredient\nReview.

Most of the ethanolamides are reported to function in\ncosmetics as hair-conditioning agents, skin-conditioning agents, and surfactant—foam boosters. The Panel reviewed available\nanimal and clinical data, as well as information from previous CIR reports.\nKeywords\nethanolamides, safety, cosmetics\nIntroduction\nThis safety assessment reviews the safety of isostearamide\nmonoethanolamine (MEA), myristamide MEA, and stearamide\nMEA, as used in cosmetics. The following 25 ingredients,\nwhich are secondary carboxamides comprising the amidation\nproducts of alkyl carboxylic acids and ethanolamines, are also\nincluded in this safety assessment, for a total of 28 ingredients\ndefined in the International Cosmetic Ingredient Dictionary\nand Handbook as ingredients:\nacetamide MEA,\nazelamide MEA,\nbabassuamide MEA,\nbehenamide MEA,\nC16-22 acid amide MEA,\ncocamide MEA,\ncocamide methyl MEA,\ncocamidopropyl betainamide MEA chloride,\nhydroxystearamide MEA,\nlactamide MEA,\nlauramide MEA,\nlinoleamide MEA,\noatamide MEA,\noleamide MEA,\noliveamide MEA,\npalm kernelamide MEA,\npalmamide MEA,\npalmitamide MEA,\npantothenamide MEA,peanutamide MEA,\nricinoleamide MEA,\nsunfloweramide MEA,\ntallowamide MEA,\ntrideceth-2 carboxamide MEA, and\nundecylenamide MEA,\nMost of the ethanolamides are reported to function in cos-\nmetics as hair-conditioning agents, skin-conditioning agents,\nand surfactant—foam boosters.\nSeveral ingredients on this list have previously been\nreviewed by the Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR). In\n1995, CIR published a safety of isostearamide MEA, myris-\ntamide MEA, and stearamide MEA1and concluded that these\n3 ingredients were safe for use in rinse-off products. In leave-\non products, these ingredients w e r es a f ef o ru s ea tc o n c e n t r a -\ntions that will limit the release of free ethanolamine to 5 %but\n1Cosmetic Ingredient Review Senior Scientific Analyst/Writer, Cosmetic\nIngredient Review, Washington, DC, USA\n2Cosmetic Ingredient Review Chemis t, Cosmetic Ingredient Review,\nWashington, DC, USA\n3Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel Member, Cosmetic Ingredient\nReview, Washington, DC, USA\n4Former Director, Cosmetic Ingredient Review, Cosmetic Ingredient Review,\nWashington, DC, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nLillian J.

In that assessment, test\ndata were used to establish limits for use concentrations\nbecause concentration of use data was not available. The\nreport further stated that these ingredients should not be used\nin cosmetic products in which N-nitroso compounds may be\nformed.\nIn 1993, the Panel concluded that acetamide MEA is safe\nas used as a cosmetic ingredient at concentrations not to\nexceed 7.5 %in leave-on products, bas ed on sensitization test\ndata, and is safe in the present practices of use in rinse-off\nproducts; cosmetic formulations containing acetamide MEA\nshould not contain nitrosatin g agents or significant amounts\nof free acetamide.2In that assessment, acetamide MEA was\nreported to be used at up to 25 %in rinse-off products. This\nconclusion was reaffirmed.3Cocamide MEA was reviewed\nin 1999; the Panel concluded that cocamide MEA is safe as\nused in rinse-off cosmetic products and safe at concentra-\ntions of up to 10 %in leave-on products.4Cocamide MEA\nw a sr e p o r t e dt ob eu s e da tu pt o2 5 %in 1984, but the types\nof products, that is, rinse-off or leave-on, were not specified.\nThe Panel also noted that cocamide MEA should not be used\nas an ingredient in cosmetic products containing N-nitrosat-\ning agents or in product formulations intended to be aero-\nsolized. The leave-on concentr ation limit was derived from\nthe concentration found safe at the time for cocamide dietha-\nnolamine (DEA); the inhalation caveat was based on con-\ncerns of inhalation toxicity of ethanolamine. These\nconclusions will be superseded by the conclusion reached\nin this safety assessment.\nThe structures and definitions of the ethanolamides are pro-\nvided in Table 1. The conclusions of the previous reports, as\nwell as those for relevant acids that have been previously\nreviewed by CIR, are provided in Table 2.\nThe data in this report apply to the safety of the 3 ingredients\npreviously reviewed and the additional 25 ingredients that are\nsecondary carboxamides, consisting of the amidation products\nof alkyl carboxylic acids and ethanolamine.\nChemistry\nThe ethanolamides consist of covalent, secondary amides,\nwhereby one of the nitrogen sub stituents is ethanol and the\nsecond is a carbonyl attached su bstituent. For example, myr-\nistamide MEA is a secondary amide wherein one of the\nnitrogen substituents is ethanol and the second is a 14 car-\nbon, carbonyl attached chain (Figure 1). These ingredients\nare not salts and do not readily dissociate in water. How-\never, amidases, such as fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH)\nwhich is known to be present in human skin, could poten-\ntially convert these amides to ethanolamine and the corre-\nsponding fatty acids.5-7S e c o n d a r ya m i d e sd ot e n dt or e a c t\nwith nitrosating agents to form nitrosamides. Chemical and\nphysical properties of ethanolamides are summarized in\nTable 3.Method of Manufacture\nEthanolamine reacts with long-chain fatty acid esters in a 1:1\nmole ratio to produce a 90 þ%pure, crystallin e ethanolamide\nmixture.8Two different routes of synthesis of ethanolamides\nare common: direct acylation with free fatty acids and trans-\nacylation using fatty acid esters (often enzymatically).9,10\nEthanolamides can be produced v ia enzymatic amidification;\nmonoacylated ethanolamine can be isolated from the reaction\nmixture. The reaction is carried out using an equimolar ratio of\nfatty acid and ethanolamine. The enzyme is filtered upon com-\npletion of the reaction, and the product is dissolved in a mixture\nof methanol and chloroform. The solvent is then eliminated by\nevaporation, and the resulting solid is the amide.\nAcetamide MEA. Acetamide MEA is prepared by the reaction of\nacetic acid with ethanolamine. Additional methods of produc-\ntion, involving acetamide and ethylene oxide, ethanolamine,\nand acetyl chloride, have been reported.2\nImpurities\nAcetamide MEA. Analysis of 4 lots of acetamide MEA by gas\nchromatography-mass spectrometry indicated the presence of\n0.0006%to 0.0029 %ethanolamine and 0.0006 %to 0.0030 %\nacetamide. Using high-performance liquid chromatography,\nN-nitrosodiethanolamine was not detected (limit of detection ¼\n0.05 ppm) in acetamide MEA.2\nMyristamide MEA. The maximum free amine content of myris-\ntamide MEA is 1.5 %.1\nStearamide MEA. Stearamide MEA has 0.8 %maximum free\nfatty acids (as stearic acid), 0.5 %to 2.0%free amine (as etha-\nnolamine), and 54.0 %to 58.0%total fatty acids (as stearic\nacid).1\nUse\nCosmetic\nMost of the ethanolamides are reported to function in cosmetics\nas hair-conditioning agents, skin-conditioning agents, and sur-\nfactant—foam boosters; a few are reported to have other uses.11\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) collects information\nfrom manufacturers on the use o f individual ingredients in\ncosmetics as a function of cosmetic product category in its\nVoluntary Cosmetic Registration Program (VCRP). The VCRP\ndata obtained from the FDA in 2011 report that stearamide\nMEA is used in 10 cosmetic formulations, myristamide MEA\nis used in 1 formulation, and isostearamide MEA does not have\nany uses reported.12Other ethanolamides included in this\nsafety assessment have many more reported uses. For example,\ncocamide MEA has the highest frequency of use, with 1122\nreported uses; only 33 of those uses are in leave-on products.\nTrideceth-2 carboxamide MEA has 189 reported uses, and\nacetamide MEA is reported to be used in 148 formulations.Fiume et al 19STable 1.

The use information for theethanolamides is provided in T able 4. In some cases, reports\nof uses were received by the VCRP, but no concentration of\nuse data was available. For example, acetamide MEA is\nreported to be used in a nail formulation, but no use concen-\ntration was available. In other cases, no reported uses were\nreceived in the VCRP, but a use concentration was provided\nin the industry survey. For example, lauramide MEA was not\nreported in the VCRP to be used in baby product formula-\ntions, but the industry survey indicated that it was used in\nsuch products at 0.5 %. It should be presumed that lauramide\nMEA is used in at least 1 baby product.

In practice, 95 %to 99%of the droplets/\nparticles released from cos metic sprays have aerodynamic\nequivalent diameters >10 mm, with propellant sprays yielding\na greater fraction of droplets/particles below 10 mm compared\nwith pump sprays.14-17Therefore, most droplets/particles inci-\ndentally inhaled from cosmetic sprays would be deposited in\nthe nasopharyngeal and bronchial regions and would not be\nrespirable (ie, they would not enter the lungs) to any appreci-\nable amount.14,16\nAcetamide MEA, stearamide MEA, and undecylenamide\nMEA are reported to be used in deodorants, and stearamide\nMEA has the highest reported concentration of use in deodor-\nants at 15 %. It is not known whether or not these products are\nsprayed. There is some evidenc e indicating that, generally,\ndeodorant spray products, compared with hair sprays, can\nrelease substantially larger fra ctions of particulates having\naerodynamic equivalent diameters in the range considered\nto be respirable.14However, the information is not sufficient\nto determine whether significantly greater lung exposures\nresult from the use of deodorant sprays, compared to other\ncosmetic sprays.\nMonoalkylamines, monoalkanolamines, and their salts are\nlisted by the European Commission in Annex III Part 1: the\nlist of substances which cosmetic products must not contain,\nexcept subject to the restrictions and conditions laid down.18These ingredients are allowed a maximum secondary amine\ncontent of 0.5 %in finished product, are not to be used with\nnitrosating agents, and must have a minimum purity of 99 %.\nThe maximum secondary amine content of 0.5 %is allowed\nfor raw materials, maximum nitrosamine content allowed is\n50mg/kg, and the chemicals must be kept in nitrite-free con-\ntainers.

In a\nstudy in which doses of 1 to 32 g/kg were used, the LD 50was\nreported to be 7.4 g/kg in rats.19,20In 2 other rat studies, the oral\nLD 50of cocamide MEA was identified as 3.3 g/kg and >3.125\ng/kg, respectively.21In studies in mice, the oral LD 50of coca-\nmide MEA was >10 g/kg in most studies. However, a value of\n3.125 g/kg was reported in 1 study using mice. (Details were\nnot provided.)\nAcetamide MEA. The oral LD 50of acetamide MEA has been\nreported as 26.95 and as 27.66 g/kg in rats.

The oral LD 50of lauramide MEA was\n>2 g/kg in rats.22\nRepeated Dose Toxicity\nDermal\nAcetamide MEA. In a 13-week study, a hair product contain-\ning 1.3%acetamide MEA, applied as an aqueous (aq) solution\nthat was diluted to 50 %(w/v), was not toxic to rabbits. Slight-\nto-moderate erythema was observed sporadically at the appli-\ncation site from days 44 to 84 of the study.2\nCocamide MEA. Cocamide MEA, 25 %in olive oil, was\napplied to mice twice a day for 1 week and the application site\nwas not covered.21No dermal reactions were observed. Addi-\ntional details were not provided.\nStearamide MEA. The dermal toxicity of a formulation con-\ntaining 17.0 %stearamide MEA was evaluated in a 4-week\nstudy in rabbits; 2 g/kg of a 10 %aq solution of the formulation\nwas applied to intact and abraded skin; no gross or microscopic\nlesions were observed. In a 13-week dermal study, a formula-\ntion containing 5.27 %stearamide MEA was not toxic in rats.1Oral\nCocamide MEA. Groups of 10 male and 10 female Wistar rats\nwere dosed by gavage with 0, 70, 250, or 750 mg/kg body\nweight (bw)/d cocamide MEA in olive oil; the high dose was\nincreased to 1500 mg/kg bw after 14 days.19The animals were\ndosed once daily, 5 /C2/wk, for 4 weeks. Recovery groups of 5\nmale and 5 female rats per dose level were included. None of\nthe animals died, and no significant test article-related gross or\nmicroscopic lesions were observed. The no observed adverse\neffect level (NOAEL) was >750 mg/kg bw/d.\nReproductive and Developmental Toxicity\nData on the reproductive and developmental toxicity of the\nethanolamides were not found. Since ethanolamine may be\npresent as an impurity in the ethanolamides, and since amidases\nin the skin could possibly convert some of the ethanolamide to\nethanolamine and the corresponding carboxylic acid, a sum-\nmary of available data from the reports on ethanolamine and\nthe constituents of these ethanolamides is provided\nsubsequently.\nMEA : In a dietary study, 0 to 7800 ppm of a composite hair\ndye and base containing 22 %ethanolamine was fed to 60\ngravid female rats on days 6 to 15 of gestation, and the\nrats were killed on day 19 of gestation. No developmental\neffects were observed. In another dietary study, 30 male\nrats were fed 0 to 7800 ppm of the hair dye for 8 weeks\nprior to mating with female rats that were being fed a\nbasal diet, while a group of 60 female rats were fed 0 to\n7800 ppm of the test substance for 8 weeks prior to mat-\ning with male rats being fed a basal diet. No effects on\nreproduction or fertility we re observed. In rabbits, no\ndevelopmental effects were observed when pregnant\nfemales were dosed by gavage on days 6 to 18 of gesta-\ntion with 0 to 19.5 mL/kg/d of the hair dye containing\n22%ethanolamine.23\nArachis hypogaea (peanut) oil : Peanut oil was used as the\nvehicle in a fertility study in rats. It was administered\norally for 28 days prior to mating and for 6 days during\nmating. No unusual findings were noted in the vehicle\ngroup. No unusual findings were observed in a teratogeni-\ncity study in which rats were injected with a test article,\nand peanut oil was used as the vehicle. Treatment-related\nchanges were not observed in a study in which rabbits\nwere dosed intramuscularly with 21 %peanut oil on day 8\nof gestation. However, in a study of the effects of oil\nvehicles on early embryonic lethality in mice, it was\nstated that plant oils proved to be unsuitable carriers of\ntest mutagens in female dominant-lethal studies where the\nroute of administration is via the peritoneal cavity.24\nHydroxystearic acid : The dermal teratogenicity of 2 formu-\nlations containing 7 %hydroxystearic acid was evaluated\nusing female rats. No teratogenic effects were observed.\n(However, dermal irritation was reported.)25Table 5.

Mean litter sizes were comparable\nbetween test and control groups. No significant changes\nwere found in liver or kidney weight in adult animals.\nNeither untreated palm oil (15 %) nor 15 %heated palm\noil in the diet induced anomalies with respect to fertility\na n di nu t e r og r o w t hw h e nf e dt om a l ea n df e m a l e\nSprague-Dawley SPF rats prior to mating. In a study\ninvestigating the effects of palm oil on sexual maturation\nand endocrine function, vaginal opening was observed\nsignificantly earlier (compared to 5 %corn oil control)\nin weanling rats fed 20 %palm oil in the diet. No signif-\nicant differences were observed in endocrine function as\ndetermined by measuring estradiol, prolactin, and lutei-\nnizing hormone.26\nPalm kernel oil : In the second generation resulting from the\nmating of adult Mongolian gerbils fed diet containing\n8.75%(w/w) palm kernel oil, no statistically significant\ndifferences were found with respect to the following:\nfrequency of litters, mean litter size, total of newborns,\nand suckling death. Animals receiving a basal diet served\nas the control group.26\nGenotoxicity\nIn Vitro\nAcetamide MEA. Acetamide MEA, /C205000mg/plate, was not\nmutagenic in the presence or absence of metabolic activa-\nt i o ni na nA m e st e s t ,a n d /C205000mg/mL acetamide MEA did\nnot induce unscheduled DNA synthesis in primary rat\nhepatocytes.2\nCocamide MEA. In an Ames test, 50 mg/plate cocamide MEA\nwas mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium TA100 with meta-\nbolic activation; it was not mutagenic with S typhimurium\nTA98, TA1535, TA1537, or TA1538, with or without meta-\nbolic activation or in TA100 without metabolic activation.\nCocamide MEA was not mutagenic in a plate incorporation\nassay.4\nThe mutagenic potential of cocamide MEA was evaluated in\nan Ames test using S typhimurium TA1535, TA1537, TA1538,\nTA98, and TA100, with and without metabolic activation.19,20\nCocamide MEA, evaluated at doses of 4 to 2500 mg/plate, was\nnot mutagenic. (No data for controls were provided.)\nLauramide MEA. The mutagenic potential of lauramide MEA\nwas evaluated in an Ames test with St y p h i m u r i u m TA98,\nTA100, TA1535, TA1537, and TA1538 at doses of 33 to\n3333mg/plate, with and without metabolic activation.27Doses\nof 3.3 and 10 mg/plate were tested with TA1537 without meta-\nbolic activation, and a dose of 10 mg/plate was tested in strains\nTA100 without metabolic activation. Negative controls wereused and gave expected results. Lauramide MEA was not muta-\ngenic in this assay.\nCarcinogenicity\nData on the carcinogenicity of the ethanolamides included in\nthis report were not found in the published literature, and no\nunpublished data were provided. Since ethanolamine may be\npresent as an impurity in the ethanolamides, and since amidases\nin the skin could possibly convert some of the ethanolamide to\nethanolamine and the corresponding carboxylic acid, a sum-\nmary of available data from the reports on constituents of these\nethanolamides is provided.\nCocamidopropyl betaine : The carcinogenic potential of a\nnonoxidative hair dye formulation containing 0.09 %\nactive cocamidopropyl betaine was determined in Swiss\nWebster mice. A dose of 0.05 mL per mouse was applied\n3 times weekly for 20 months to interscapular skin that\nwas clipped free of hair. Dermal changes were noted, but\nthe incidence of neoplasms in treated animals did not\ndiffer significantly from control groups.28\nHydroxystearic acid : In an 18-month subcutaneous carcino-\ngenicity study in female Swiss-Webster mice, hydroxys-\ntearic acid was injected subcutaneously twice weekly for\na total dose of 4 or 80 mg delivered in a total of 8 mL\ntricaprylin. Hydroxystearic acid was classified as tenta-\ntively carcinogenic in Swiss-Webster mice. Subcutaneous\nsarcomas were observed at the site of injection in 9 of the\n28 mice (14 per dose group) that were alive at 6 months.\nAll of the sarcomas were observed in the low-dose group.\nIn a second study in which 9 A/He male mice received a\ntotal intraperitoneal dose of 60 mg hydroxystearic acid\nover a period of 4 weeks, the frequency of lung tumors\nwas within the spontaneous occurrence.25\nLactic acid : Female rabbits were dosed by gavage with 0.1 to\n0.2 g/kg lactic acid in 100 to 150 mL water twice daily for\n5 months, and 5 female rabbits were dosed orally with 0.1\nto 0.7 g/kg lactic acid in 50 to 100 mL water twice daily\nfor 16 months. No tumors were reported.29\nLauric acid : Treatment of mice with repeated subcutaneous\ni n j e c t i o n so f2 5a n d5 0m gl a u r i ca c i dw a sn o t\ncarcinogenic.30\nOleic acid : Intestinal and gastric tumors were found in mice\nreceiving dietary oleic acid at daily concentrations of up\nto 200 mg/mouse. No malignant tumors were induced by\nrepeated subcutaneous injections of 1 to 16.5 mg oleic\nacid in 2 species of mice.30\nPalmitic acid : Feeding of 50 g/kg/d palmitic acid to rats\nresulted in lipogranulomas observed in fat associated with\nthe testis or ovary; this lesion was reversible upon diet\nsubstitution and attributed to dietary imbalance. Low\nincidences of carcinomas, sarcomas, and lymphomas\nwere observed in mice receiving single or repeated sub-\ncutaneous injections of 25 and 50 mg palmitic acid.30Fiume et al 29SRicinoleic acid : None of 20 mice injected intravaginally\nwith 2%ricinoleic acid (in gum tragacanth) had neo-\nplasms or hyperplastic lesions of the corpus uteri, cervix\nuteri, vagina, or perineal skin. However, benign lung ade-\nnomas were observed in 10 of the 13 mice dosed with\nricinoleic acid and in 6 of the 24 vehicle control mice that\nwere killed after the 14th month of dosing.31\nStearic acid : Feeding of up to 50 g/kg/d dietary stearic acid\nto mice was not carcinogenic. Low incidences of carci-\nnomas, sarcomas, and lymphomas were observed in mice\nreceiving single or repeated subcutaneous injections of\n/C2082 mg stearic acid.30\nIrritation and Sensitization\nIrritation\nDermal\nNonhuman. Acetamide MEA\nAcetamide MEA, applied neat, was a mild skin irritant in an\nopen-patch Draize test in 12 rabbits. In another study, aceta-\nmide MEA (70 %active, minimum) was not a primary irritant\nwhen applied to the intact and abraded skin of rabbits using a\n24-hour occlusive patch.2\nCocamide MEA\nThe irritancy potential of 50 %cocamide MEA in petrolatum\nwas evaluated in a 24-hour patch test in guinea pigs, rabbits,\nand hairless mice. Cocamide MEA was slightly irritating to\nrabbits but was not irritating to guinea pigs and hairless mice.4\nThe irritation potential of cocamide MEA was evaluated in\nrabbits.21Cocamide MEA, 25 %, was not irritating to rabbits\nwhen applied under an occlusive patch for 24 hours. (Addi-\ntional details were not provided.)\nLauramide MEA\nIn a Draize study, lauramide MEA was not irritating to\nrabbit skin.22No details were provided.\nStearamide MEA\nThe primary irritation index of a formulation containing\n17.0%stearamide MEA was 1.00/8 in a group of 3 rabbits.1\nHuman. Irritation data were available from earlier CIR\nsafety assessments indicate that acetamide MEA and cocamide\nMEA were not irritating; however, a 1 %aq solution of a for-\nmulation containing 17 %stearamide MEA produced question-\nable to mild reactions in 10 of the 19 subjects in the study.1,2,4\nIn a 21-day, 14-subject, cumulative irritation study in which 0.2\nmL of a formulation containing 5.0 %stearamide MEA was\napplied using occlusive patches, slight irritation was observed,\nwith a composite total score of 156/882.\nSensitization\nNonhuman\nAcetamide MEA. Acetamide MEA was not a sensitizer in a\nmaximization study using 10 guinea pigs. Induction included\nan intradermal injection of 5.0 %acetamide MEA in propyleneglycol and in Freund’s complete adjuvant and a topical\napplication of 10 %acetamide MEA.2\nCocamide MEA. Cocamide MEA was not a sensitizer in a guinea\npig maximization study. Details were not provided.21\nHuman\nAcetamide MEA. In earlier CIR safety assessments that sup-\nport the safety of ethanolamides, aq solution of 7.5 %acetamide\nMEA did not cause primary irritation or sensitization in a 50-\nsubject study, however, a repeated insult patch test (RIPT) of a\nhair product containing 1.3 %acetamide MEA showed mild\nreactions during induction a nd challenge. However, the\nresearchers concluded that a hair product containing 1.3 %acet-\namide MEA was not a sensitizer.2\nStearamide MEA. In an RIPT using 100 subjects in which 0.1\nmL of formulation containing 5.27 %stearamide MEA was\napplied using occlusive patches, the formulation did not pro-\nduce sensitization.1\nOcular Irritation\nNonhuman. Irritation data from earlier CIR safety assessments\nshowthat 1.3 %acetamide MEA and 5.27 %stearamide MEA were\nnot irritating to rabbit eyes however 70 %minimal activity of\nacetamide MEA was practically nonirritating and 17 %stearamide\nMEA was reported to be minimally to moderately irritating.1,2\nLauramide MEA. In a Draize ocular irritation study, Laura-\nmide MEA was highly irritating to rabbit eyes.22Details were\nnot provided.\nSummary\nThis report assesses the safety of 28 ethanolamides. This safety\nassessment originated as a rereview of isostearamide MEA,\nmyristamide MEA, and stearamide MEA and was expanded\nto include 25 additional related ingredients. Some of these\ningredients have been previously reviewed by the CIR and are\nincluded because they fit scientifically and conceptually within\nthis family of ingredients.\nAmidases, such as FAAH, which is known to be present in\nhuman skin, could potentially convert the ethanolamides to etha-\nnolamine and the corresponding fatty acids. The yield of ethano-\nlamine from metabolism of ethanolamides in human skin is\nunknown. Also, secondary amides do tend to react with nitrosat-\ning agents to form nitrosamides. Impurity data were available for\nacetamide, myristamide, and stearamide MEA: acetamide MEA\ncontained up to 0.0029 %ethanolamine, 0.0030 %acetamide, and\nnoN-nitrosodiethanolamine; myristamide contained a maximum\nof 1.5%ethanolamine; and stearamide MEA contained up to\n2.0%free amine (as ethanolamine).\nMost of the ethanolamides are reported to function in cos-\nmetics as hair-conditioning agents, skin-conditioning agents,\nand surfactant—foam boosters; a few are reported to have other\nuses. In 2011, stearamide MEA was reported to have only 10\nuses, myristamide MEA had 1, and isostearamide had none.30S International Journal of Toxicology 34(Supplement 1)Cocamide MEA has the highest frequency of use, with 1122\nreported uses; only 33 of those are in leave-on products. Coca-\nmide MEA is reported to be used at up to 18 %in rinse-off\nformulations and at up to 5 %in leave-on formulations. Stear-\namide MEA has the highest concentration of use in leave-on\nformulations at up to 15 %. In Europe, monoalkylamines,\nmonoalkanolamines, and their salts are on the list of substances\nthat must not form part of the composition of cosmetic prod-\nucts, except subject to restrictions and conditions laid down.\nAcetamide MEA and babassuamide MEA are included in this\nlist. These restrictions include a maximum secondary amines\ncontaminant content of 0.5 %in finished products, a maximum\nsecondary amines content of 0.5 %in raw materials, and a\nmaximum nitrosamine content of 50 mg/kg.\nIn an acute dermal study in rabbits, the LD 50for cocamide\nMEA was >2 g/kg and for acetamide MEA, it was >20 mL/kg. In\noral studies, the LD 50of cocamide MEA was >5 g/kg in rats and\n>10 g/kg in mice. The oral LD 50values in rats for acetamide and\nlauramide MEA were 27 and >2 g/kg, respectively. In repeated\ndose dermal studies, acetamide MEA (50 %; 13 weeks in rab-\nbits), cocamide MEA (25 %; 1 week in mice), and stearamide\nMEA (10 %solution of a formulation containing 17 %in rabbits,\napplied for 4 weeks; 5.27 %in rats, applied for 13 weeks) were\nnot toxic. In a 14-day oral study, the NOAEL of cocamide MEA\nin rats was >750 mg/kg/d, the highest dose tested.\nNo data on the reproductive and developmental toxicity or\ncarcinogenicity of the ethanolamides included in this report\nwere found. Available data from previous CIR reports on etha-\nnolamine and some of the constituents were summarized, and\nno relevant toxic effects were noted.\nAcetamide MEA ( /C205000mg/plate), cocamide MEA ( /C202500\nmg/plate), and lauramide MEA ( /C203333mg/plate) were not\nmutagenic in Ames tests with or without metabolic activation.\nAcetamide MEA did not induce unscheduled DNA synthesis in\nprimary rat hepatocytes.\nAcetamide MEA was a mild skin irritant in rabbits and in\nhumans, and a formulation containing 0.5 %acetamide MEA\nwas not an irritant. Cocamide MEA was slightly irritating to\nrabbit skin and was not irritating to guinea pigs and hairless\nmice. In clinical testing, 50 %cocamide MEA in petrolatum\nwas not irritating. A formulation containing 17 %stearamide\nMEA had a primary irritation score of 1/8 in rabbits, and in a\nclinical single-insult occlusive patch test, a 1 %aq solution of\nthis formulation produced questionable reactions in 7 and mild\nreactions in 3 of 19 subjects; in a clinical cumulative irritation\nstudy, 5 %stearamide MEA produced slight irritation. Aceta-\nmide MEA and cocamide MEA were not sensitizers in guinea\npigs. In clinical testing, a solution of 7.5 %acetamide MEA, a\nformulation containing 1.3 %acetamide MEA, and a formula-\ntion containing 5.27 %stearamide MEA were not sensitizers.\nAcetamide MEA (70 %minimum activity) was practically\nnonirritating to rabbit eyes, and formulations containing 1.3 %\nacetamide MEA and 5.27 %stearamide MEA were not irritat-\ning to rabbit eyes. A formulation containing 17 %stearamide\nMEA was a moderate ocular irritant, and lauramide MEA was\nhighly irritating to rabbit eyes.Discussion\nIsostearamide MEA, myristamide MEA, and stearamide MEA,\nalong with acetamide MEA and cocamide MEA, have been\nreviewed previously by the CIR Expert Panel. This amended\nsafety assessment includes those 5 ingredients and 23 addi-\ntional ethanolamides that are also secondary carboxamides\ncomprising the amidation products of alkyl carboxylic acids\nand ethanolamine. This amended safety assessment was origi-\nnated as a rereview of isostearamide MEA, myristamide MEA,\nand stearamide MEA and was expanded to include the addi-\ntional ethanolamides, the safety of which was supported by the\ndata available in the original safety assessment and by other\npublished and unpublished studies.\nThe Panel noted gaps in the available safety data for other\nend points for many of the ethanolamides included in this\ngroup. Because these ingredients are secondary amides,\nwhereby one of the nitrogen substituents is ethanol and the\nsecond is a carbonyl attached substituent, their chemical struc-\ntures are similar, their structure–activity relationships are\nexpected to be similar, and their functions in cosmetics are\nsimilar, supporting the use of the available data to support the\nsafety of all the ethanolamides included in this safety\nassessment.\nPublished toxicokinetics data are lacking, as are reproduc-\ntive and developmental toxicity and carcinogenicity data. How-\never, the Panel was of the opinion that dermal penetration\nwould be limited based on the size and the lipophilicity of these\nethanolamides. Based on the totality of the data set, the Panel\ndid not think these ingredients would have reproductive or\ncarcinogenic effects.\nAlso, while it is a metabolic possibility that amidases\npresent in human skin could potentially convert the ethano-\nlamides to ethanolamine and the corresponding acid, such\npotential amidase activity would at most cleave a small frac-\ntion of the applied ethanolamides. If these ethanolamides\nwere cleaved into ethanolamine and the respective acids, the\nsubstantial data available on ethanolamine and other consti-\ntuents indicate that these components do not have reproduc-\ntive or carcinogenic effects.\nBecause it could be possible that DEA may exist as an\nimpurity, the Panel reiterated its discussion regarding the pos-\nitive findings reported in a dermal carcinogenicity study of\nDEA. The hepatocarcinogenicity that was reported in mice was\nconsidered to have little relevance to the safety of DEA in\npersonal care products. Additionally, renal lesions reported in\nmice could have been the result of DEA-induced choline defi-\nciency, a mechanism that has little relevance in humans. If\nDEA-induced choline deficiency was not the cause of the renal\nlesions, it was thought there was still no carcinogenic risk to\nhumans because DEA does not appear to penetrate human skin\nto any significant extent at concentrations relevant to human\nexposures from the use of personal care products.\nThe ethanolamides consist of covalent, secondary amides.\nThe Panel was concerned that secondary amides tend to react\nwith nitrosating agents to form nitrosamides. Because of theFiume et al 31Spotential for this process to occur, ethanolamides should not be\nused in cosmetic products in which N-nitroso compounds may\nbe formed.\nThe potential exists for dermal irritation with the use of\nproducts formulated using ethanolamides. The Panel specified\nthat products containing ethanolamides must be formulated to\nbe nonirritating. Test data indicate that these ingredients are not\nsensitizers.\nBecause the ethanolamides can be used in products that may\nbe aerosolized, including aerosol hair sprays and foot sprays,\nthe Panel discussed the issue of incidental inhalation exposure.\nIn the absence of inhalation data, the Panel noted that there was\nlack of systemic toxicity in dermal and oral single and repeated\ndose toxicity studies, negative results for genotoxicity in Ames\ntests and an unscheduled DNA synthesis assay, and little to no\nirritation potential and no sensitization potential. Further, this\ningredient is reportedly used at concentrations of /C201%in cos-\nmetic products that may be aerosolized. The Panel noted that\n95%to 99%of droplets/particles produced in cosmetic aerosols\nwould not be respirable to any appreciable amount. However,\nthe potential for inhalation toxicity is not limited to respirable\ndroplets/particles deposited in the lungs. Inhaled droplets/par-\nticles deposited in the nasopharyngeal and bronchial regions of\nthe respiratory tract may cause toxic effects depending on their\nchemical and other properties. Nevertheless, coupled with the\nsmall actual exposure in the breathing zone and the concentra-\ntions at which the ingredients are used, the available informa-\ntion indicates that incidental inhalation would not be a\nsignificant route of exposure that might lead to local respiratory\nor systemic effects.\nConclusion\nThe CIR Expert Panel concluded that the ethanolamides listed\nsubsequently are safe in the present practices of use and con-\ncentration described in this safety assessment when formulated\nto be nonirritating. The Expert Panel cautioned that these ingre-\ndients should not be used in cosmetic products in which\nN-nitroso compounds may be formed.\nacetamide MEA,\nazelamide MEA*,\nbabassuamide MEA*,\nbehenamide MEA*,\nC16-22 acid amide MEA*,\ncocamide MEA,\ncocamide methyl MEA,\ncocamidopropyl betainamide MEA chloride,\nhydroxystearamide MEA*,\nisostearamide MEA*,\nlactamide MEA,\nlauramide MEA,\nlinoleamide MEA*,\nmyristamide MEA,\noatamide MEA*,\noleamide MEA*,oliveamide MEA*,\npalm kernelamide MEA*,\npalmamide MEA*,\npalmitamide MEA*,\npantothenamide MEA*,\npeanutamide MEA,\nricinoleamide MEA,\nstearamide MEA,\nsunfloweramide MEA*,\ntallowamide MEA*,\ntrideceth-2 carboxamide MEA, and\nundecylenamide MEA,\nWere the ingredients not in current use (as indicated by *) to\nbe used in the future, the expectation is that they would be used\nin product categories and at concentrations comparable to oth-\ners in this group.\nAuthors’ Note\nUnpublished sources cited in this report are available from the Direc-\ntor, Cosmetic Ingredient Review, 1620 L Street, NW, Suite 1200,\nWashington, DC 20036, USA.\nAuthor Contributions\nM.

{"id": 11, "text": "27Final Report on the Safety Assessment of Azulene1\n1Reviewed by the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel. Dawn\nR. Teufel, former Scientific Analyst and Writer, prepared this report.\nAddress correspondence to Dr. F. Alan Andersen, Director, CIR, 1101 \n17th Street, NW, Suite 310, Washington, DC 20036, USA.Azulene is an extract from the volatile oil of several perennial\nherbs and is detected in tobacco smoke. It functions as a skin con-\nditioning agent in cosmetic formulations, including hair dyes. Azu-\nlene is reported to be used in a wide range of cosmetic formula-\ntions, but these reported uses are likely to be uses of guaiazulene,\na chemically related colorant, because there are currently no sup-\npliers of Azulene to the cosmetics industry. The anti-inflammatory\naction of Azulene has been demonstrated in several animal stud-\nies. Effects at the cellular level are reported to include inhibi-\ntion of respiration and growth, but no effect on ciliary activity\nor membrane permeability. Relatively low oral toxicity was seen\nin acute animal studies. Azulene was not mutagenic in an Ames\ntest, with and without metabolic acfivation. An allergic response\nto Azulene was noted in one case report. These data were clearly\ninsufficient to support the safety of Azulene in cosmetics. Addi-\ntional data needed to make a safety assessment include: methods\nof manufacture and impurities, especially naphthalenes; current\nconcentration of use; skin penetration, if there is significant skin\npenetration, then both a 28-day dermal toxicity study to assess\ngeneral skin and systemic toxicity and a reproductive and devel-\nopmental toxicity study are needed; one genotoxicity study in a\nmammalian system, if positive, then a 2-year dermal carcinogen-\nesis study using National Toxicology Program methods is needed;\nskin irritation and sensitization in animals or humans; and ocular\ntoxicity.\nINTRODUCTION\nAzulene functions as a skin conditioning agent in cosme-\ntic formulations. Although Azulene has an intense blue or\nblue-violet color, its use as a colorant in the United States\nhas not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration\n(FDA). Guaiazulene ( 1,4-dimethyl-7-isopropylazulene), an azu-\nlene derivative, meets U.S. color additive standards and is per-\nmitted for use as a colorant in externally applied cosmetics\n(Code of Federal Regulations §73.2180). Guiazulene is some-\ntimes mistakenly termed Azulene. The true Azulene is an extract\nfrom the volatile oil of several perennial herbs such as Yarrow\n(Achillea millefolium), Peppermint (Mentha X piperita L.), Ele-\ncampane (Inula helenium L.), and Calamus (Acorus calamus)\n(Leung 1980). This report reviews the published safety data on\nAzulene.CHEMISTRY\nDefinition and Structure\nAzulene (CAS No. 275-51-4) conforms to the formula shown\nin Figure 1 (Gordon 1952; Wenninger and McEwen 1997). Other\nnames for this chemical include: Cyclopentacycloheptene, Bicy-\nclo(5.3.0)decapentaene, Bicyclo(O.3.5)deca-1,3,5,7,9-pentaene,\nand Bicyclo(5.3.0)deca-2,4,6,8,10-pentaene (Registry of Toxic\nEffects of Chemical Substances [RTECS] 1994).\nPhysical and Chemical Properties\nThe most striking property of azulene is its intense blue or\nblue-violet color, noticeable even at high dilutions. Azulene and\nits derivatives are soluble in concentrated mineral acids. They\ncan also be reprecipitated unchanged by dilution with water, al-\nlowing for the effective separation from nearly all contaminants\n(Gordon 1952). The physical and chemical properties of azulene\nare summarized in Table 1.\nManufacture and Production\nAzulene is extracted from plants through distillation fol-\nlowed by chromatography (Rao and Nigam 1974). Azulene\ncan also be prepared from certain volatile oils such as oil of\ncubebs (Taylor 1988), as well as octahydronaphthalene or indan\n(Budavari 1989). Small amounts of Azulene have been obtained\nby the dry distillation of calcium adipate and by the dehydro-\ngenation of caucal oil. A historical method of synthesizing Azu-\nlene is to react indan with diazoacetic acid in a ring-expansion\nprocedure. The reagent action on the various Kekule forms leads\nto the Azulene end-product (Gordon 1952).\nAnalytical Methods\nAzulene is identified through gas-liquid chromatography,\nthin layer chromatography, gas chromatography (Adams, Van\nEngelen, and Thomas 1984), gas chromatography/mass spec-\ntroscopy (Hawley-Fedder, Parsons, and Karasek 1984), ultra-\nviolet (UV) absorbance, fluorescence, and column chromatog-\nraphy. Infrared, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and mass\nspectroscopy data are also available (Grasselli 1973).\nUltraviolet Absorbance\nAzulene has absorption maxima at 665, 659, 632, 579, 340,\nand 274 nm (Grasselli 1973). In other reports, the absorption\nmaxima and minima were at 353, 340, 326, 296, and (the max-\nimum) 272 mtt (Susz, Pfao, and Plattner 1937); and 238, 273\n28\nFIGURE 1\nChemical formula for Azulene.\n(maximum), 279, 295, 326, 336, 341, 351, and 359 (minimum)\n(Plattner and Heilbronner 1948).\nReactivity\nAzulene is isomeric with naphthalene. One study determined\nthat azulene reacts more like an alkene than a polycyclic aromatic\nhydrocarbon in gas-phase reactions with 03 and the OH and N03\nradicals (Atkinson, Arey, and Aschmann 1992). At 350-430°C\nthe Azulene rearranges to form naphthalene, which was also\nobtained when azulenes were heated over silica gel at 300°C in\na vacuum (Gordon 1952).\nAzulene has a significant dipole moment and is prone to elec-\ntrophilic attack at carbons 1 and 3 (Hanzlik and Bhatia 1981),\nwhereas nucleophilic and radical substitution can occur at posi-\ntion 4 (Gordon 1952).\nReduction of Azulene with sodium in amyl alcohol or sodium\namalgam resulted in a hydrocarbon that was isomeric with the\nTABLE 1\nPhysical and chemical properties of Azulenesesquiterpene fractions of plant oils from which Azulene was\nobtained. This hydrocarbon reacted with sulfur at 180°C to give a\nblue distillate that was identical to the starting compound Gordon\n1952).\nUSE\nCosmetic\nAzulene functions as a skin conditioning agent in cosmetic\nformulations. Product formulation data submitted to the FDA\nin 1996 indicated that azulene was used in 43 cosmetic prod-\nuct formulations (Table 2) (FDA 1996). There are, however,\nno suppliers of Azulene to the cosmetics industry. The possi-\nbility exists, therefore, that the reports of use actually reflect\nguiazulene usage. Concentration of use values are no longer\nsubmitted to the FDA by the cosmetic industry (FDA 1992).\nHowever, product formulation data submitted to the FDA in\n1984 stated that azulene was used at concentrations up to 10l0\n(FDA 1984).\nTABLE 2\nProduct formulation data for Azulene (FDA 1996)\n29\nNoncosmetic\nSome analytical techniques use Azulene as a real-time perfor-\nmance monitoring agent in column chromatography (Nowicki\n1980). Also, experimental evidence suggests that Azulene has\nantiulcer effects in animals (Leung 1980; Okabe et al. 1975).\nAzulene is classified as a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent\n(Chemline 1994). Fractionation studies have also identified Azu-\nlene as one of the 3000 compounds in tobacco smoke (Pettersson,\nCurvall, and Enzell 1980).\nGENERAL BIOLOGY\nMetaboBism and Excretion\nIn a study using male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-350 g, num-\nber not stated), Azulene was administered orally in corn oil\n(Hanzlik and Bhatia 1981). The rats were given doses ranging\nfrom 10 to 200 mg/kg for normal rats and up to 300 mg/kg\nin rats induced by phenobarbital (60 mg/kg i.p. once a day for\n3 days). Azulene metabolism was the same in both normal and\ninduced rats and only data for the normal rats were presented.\nUrine, collected during the first 24 hours, was dark blue, but at\n24-48 hours very little blue color was observed.\nAzulene metabolism was studied by orally dosing three rats\nwith [3H]-Azulene in corn oil at 13 mg/kg or 1 /tCi/rat. During\nthe first 24 hours 67, 77, and 83% of the administered 3H were\ndetected in the urine. The radioactive compound was isolated and\nidentified as the sulfate conjugate of 1-hydroxyazulene (Hanzlik\nand Bhatia 1981).\nThe metabolism of [1,3-2H2]-Azulene was studied after in-\ntraperitoneal administration in corn oil. From the NMR spec-\ntrum, the C-3 deuterium was present in the metabolite, but the\nC-2 deuterium was not detected. This suggested that the NIH\nshift mechanism retention of deuterium during hydroxylation\nhad not occurred and that if a 1,2-oxide of Azulene formed, then\nrearrangement with direct loss of the C-1 deuterium could have\nresulted (Hanzlik and Bhatia 1981).\nAnti-Inflammatory Action\nEucalyptus oil Azulene (100 mg/kg) was injected intramus-\ncularly into rabbits (number not stated) which had bums of the\nexternal ear. The first injection was within 2 hours after the bum\nand subsequent injections were made daily for 5 days. A reduc-\ntion of inflammatory edema and blood coagulation, induced by\nthe bum, was observed. Leukocytosis increased, but hemoglobin\nand erythrocyte content in the blood were unaffected (Lysenko\n1967).\nIn another study, 1 % croton oil was topically applied to the\nconjunctival sac of rabbits (number not stated) to induce hyper-\nemia and edema. These signs had a peak appearance between 1\nand 2 hours after the application and disappeared after 24 hours.\nThe administration of Azulene (1-2%) delayed the onset of the\ncroton oil-induced effects. Side effects were not mentioned in\nthe abstract (Kimura et al. 1985).Guillot et al. (1983) investigated the potential of 55 sub-\nstances, including, Azulene, to reduce irritation. An ionic oil\nin water emulsion of triethanolamine-stearate (TEA-stearate)\nwas made irritating by the addition of 0.25% croton oil and ap-\nplied to both intact and scarified clipped skin of six male New\nZealand white rabbits on 0.5-ml patches for 24 hours. The chem-\nicals were applied to symmetrical areas on the flanks and back of\neach animal; the irritant base without the test substance served as\ncontrol. The croton oil-containing emulsion produced a primary\ncutaneous irritation index (PII) value close to 2. The addition of\n0.2% and 0.4% (wlw) Azulene decreased the irritancy by 0.21 1\nand 0.42, respectively (Guillot et al. 1983).\nPharmacodynamic Effects\nAzulene is one of the 3000 identified components found in\ntobacco smoke (Pettersson, Curvall, and Enzell 1980). Several\nstudies have tested the effects of individual tobacco smoke con-\nstituents on various biological functions. A study by Pettersson,\nCurvall, and Enzell (1980) measured the effects of 320 tobacco\nsmoke compounds on the noradrenaline-induced oxidative\nmetabolism of brown fat cells isolated from adult hamsters\n(Mesocricetus auratus). Noradrenaline increases metabolic res-\npiration in brown fat cells 15 times the basal rate. The cells were\nincubated with azulene dissolved in ethanol or dimethyl sul-\nfoxide (controls) for 5 minutes. After this preincubation, 1 ~.cM\nnoradrenaline (approximately twice the dose needed to induce\nmaximal respiratory rate) was added and cellular consumption of\noxygen was recorded for 5 minutes. The excess noradrenaline\nprevented the inactivation of noradrenaline per se by the test\nsubstance. Substance toxicity was determined by comparing\nthe inhibition of the noradrenaline-stimulated respiration to that\nof a control. Azulene (1 mM) inhibited respiration 46% in the\nnoradrenaline-stimulated brown fat cells. Azulene was consid-\nered a low to moderate inhibitor. It was noted that in electron\nmicrographs brown fat cells had little development of endoplas-\nmic reticulum, in which case detoxification enzymes could have\nbeen lacking.\nThe ciliotoxicities of 316 compounds, including azulene,\npresent in tobacco smoke were tested in vitro using chicken\ntracheal organ cultures (Pettersson, Curvall, and Enzell 1982).\nThe tracheas of 16- to 17-day-old embryos were cut transversely\ninto rings and incubated with 5% C02 and air at 37°C and\n80% relative humidity. (Ciliary activity can be maintained under\nthese conditions for more than 4 weeks.) Azulene, dissolved in\nethanol or dimethyl sulfoxide, was tested at a concentration of\n5 mM for, at most, 1 hour. The solvent concentration used in\nthe experiment was not inhibitory to the cilia. The cessation of\nciliary activity in the presence of the test compound within the\n1-hour period was an indication of chemical toxicity. All test\ncompounds, including Azulene, were tested three times using\ntracheal preparations from different embryos. Azulene ciliosta-\nsis did not occur within the 60-minute period. However, pre-\ncipitation of Azulene in the test mixture was noted. The actual\n30\nconcentration of dissolved Azulene after precipitation was not\ndetermined.\nThe effects of Azulene and 463 other tobacco smoke com-\npounds on the percent increase in the membrane permeability of\ncultured human lung fibroblasts were investigated (Thelestam,\nCurvall, and Enzell 1980). Diploid embryonic lung fibroblasts\nwere exposed to [3H]uridine nucleotides, low-molecular-weight\ncytoplasmic markers. Cells were incubated for 30 minutes at\n37°C at a concentration of 25 mM Azulene or other test com-\npound. The release of the radioactive marker from the cells in-\ndicated the degree of membrane damage. To avoid cytotoxic\neffects and increase sensitivity, a short exposure time was cho-\nsen. Maximal radioactive release (positive control) was achieved\nby treating the cells with sodium borate buffer and scraping.\nAzulene stimulated the nucleotide release by 2% which was\nconsidered a nil effect.\nThe effects of approximately 250 tobacco smoke compounds\nwere separately tested in vitro using Ascites sarcoma B P8 cells\nto determine the inhibition of cell multiplication (Pilotti et al.\n1975). The compounds were each dissolved in ethanol (10 ¡Ll)\nor dimethyl sulfoxide (10 izl), added to the cell suspension,\nand incubated at 37°C for 48 hours. The controls were cultures\ntreated with only solvent or cultures inoculated with chemicals\nproducing known inhibitory effects. Azulene, tested in the cell\ncultures at final concentrations of 1 mM and 0.1 mM, inhibited\nthe growth rate by 85% and 7%, respectively.\nANIMAL TOXICOLOGY\nAcute Toxicity\nThe acute oral LD50S in the rat and mouse were 4 g/kg and\n3 g/kg, respectively. Experimental details were not reported. The\nintravenous LDso in the mouse was 56 mg/kg. The subcutaneous\nLDsos in the rat and mouse were 520 mg/kg and 145 mg/kg,\nrespectively. The intraperitoneal LDsos in the rat and mouse\nwere 180 mg/kg and 108 mg/kg, respectively (RTECS 1994).\nChronic Toxicity\nGershbein and Benuck (1975) implanted crystallized frag-\nments or saline suspensions of hydrocarbons, including Azu-\nlene (as the control chemical), into the brains of 70-day-old\nHoltzmann rats and adult BDFi mice in order to discern early\nbrain changes. Crystals of each of the hydrocarbons (1,2,5,6-\ndibenzanthracene, 9,10-dimethyl- 1,2-benzanthracene [DMBA],\n3-methylcholanthrene, and Azulene) were crushed together to\nform pellets of uniform size, which were then implanted corti-\ncally into groups of 14 male rats. Fine suspensions (1.0 mg/ml)\nof each of the hydrocarbons in saline (total volume of 0.05 ml)\nwere introduced intracerebrally into groups of 12 male mice.\nControl rats and mice received saline cortically at, respectively,\n0.1 and 0.05 ml. Rats were killed after 56 days and mice were\nkilled at 140 days by intracardial perfusion with saline followed\nby formalin. The brains were removed, examined, sectioned,and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Any detected lesions\nwere mapped. Of the 14 brains of rats implanted with DMBA,\nsix had inflammatory, space-occupying lesions at day 56, and\nthe rats were lethargic. The lesions were focal areas of necrosis\nand surrounded by an edematous border. Compression of the\ncontralateral hemisphere was noted. Although a neoplasm was\nnot detected, the lesion contained crystals of hydrocarbon in its\ninterior. Outcropping and infiltration into the corpus callosum\nand hippocampus were observed. The remainder of the brains of\nrats treated with DMBA, as well as those treated with Azulene\nand the other hydrocarbons, had non-space-occupying lesions\nwithout edema or atypical cells encountered. The lesions due\nto Azulene implantation were somewhat larger and deeper than\nthose arising from 3-methylcholanthrene treatment (1.55 mm\nin length; greatest diameter of 2.5 mm with superficial damage\nto the hemispheres), but the dimensions were not given. Rats\ninjected with saline had negligible changes.\nIn a second series of rats in the same study, five males and\nfour females (32- and 68-day-old, respectively) were similarly\ninjected with DMBA and killed on day 128. Azulene was im-\nplanted into 18 males: 10 were 32 days old and the remainder\nwere 74 days old. All rats treated with Azulene were killed on\ndays 128 and 146, respectively.\nFive male and two female rats injected with DMBA had\nhemorrhagic, cortical space-occupying lesions of foreign-body\ngranulomatous inflammation with multinucleated cells. The re-\nmaining rats (DMBA- and Azulene-treated) all had non-space-\noccupying lesions. No other details were given. Treated mice\nunderwent little change in brain anatomy up to 140 days after\ntreatment (Gershbein and Benuck 1975).\nMUTAGENICITY\nThe mutagenic potential of Azulene was evaluated in an\nAmes test that was performed using Salmonella typhimurium\nstrains TA98, TA100, TA1535, and TA1537 (Florin et al. 1980).\nWithout metabolic activation, the positive control was N -methyl-\nN’-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine. With metabolic activation, 2-\naminoanthracene served as the positive control. Azulene was\nspot-tested at 3 pmovplate with and without S-9A (arochlor-\ninduced rats) and S-9M (3-methylcholanthrene-induced rats).\nAzulene was not mutagenic. In the same study, Azulene was\ntested quantitatively for toxicity on strains TA98 and TA100\nwith and without metabolic activation using S-9M. Azulene was\nplated at concentrations of 0.03, 0.3, 3, and 30 pmovplate. Azu-\nlene was toxic to the bacterial strain at 3 pmovplate and higher.\nCLINICAL ASSESSMENT C3F SAFETY\nIn one case report, a 26-year-old woman who had been us-\ning a toothpaste containing Azulene for several years developed\nredness, dryness, scaling, and cracking of the skin and vermil-\nlion surrounding her lips. Patch tests produced allergic cheilitis\nat 48 and 72 hours when both the toothpaste and 1 °lo Azulene\nwere administered. All signs and clinical manifestations cleared\n31\nwhen use of the toothpaste was discontinued and the patient\nunderwent topical steroid treatment (Balato et al. 1985).\nSUMMARY\nAzulene functions as a skin conditioning agent in cosmetic\nformulations. Although Azulene exhibits an intense blue or blue-\nviolet color, use of Azulene as a colorant in the United States\nhas not been approved by the FDA. Data submitted to the FDA\nin 1996 stated that Azulene is found in 43 cosmetic formula-\ntions, although there are no suppliers to the cosmetics industry.\nAnother cosmetic ingredient, Guaiazulene, is sometimes mis-\ntakenly called Azulene, which could explain the reported uses.\nAzulene is an extract from the volatile oil of several peren-\nnial herbs and is found in tobacco smoke. Azulene is obtained\nfrom plants by extraction and distillation. Azulene is classified\nas a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent. It is also isomeric\nwith napthalene. Azulene has a significant dipole moment and\nis prone to electrophilic attack at carbons 1 and 3; and nucle-\nophilic and radical substitution occur at carbon 4. Maximum\nUV absorbance occurs at 272-277 nm; the minimum occurs at\n359 nm.\nIn labeling studies using rats, Azulene was metabolized to\nthe sulfate conjugate of 1-hydroxyazulene. Between 67-83%\nof the administered radioactivity was detected in the urine during\nthe first 24 hours after dosing.\nThe anti-inflammatory action of Azulene has been demon-\nstrated in several animal studies. Azulene injected into burned\nrabbits reduced inflammatory edema and blood coagulation in-\nduced by the bums. Leukocytosis increased, but hemoglobin\ncontent and erythrocyte counts in the blood did not change. In\nanother study, the onset of hyperemia and edema induced by\ntopical application of 1 % croton oil into the conjunctival sac of\nrabbits was delayed by treatment with Azulene. In a third study\nusing rabbits, the dermal irritancy caused by 0.25% croton oil\nwas decreased by the application of Azulene.\nAzulene was a low to moderate inhibitor of respiration in\nnoradrenaline-stimulated brown fat cells. Azulene did not in-\nduce the cessation of ciliary activity in cultures of chicken tra-\ncheal organs, and negligible effects were observed in membrane\npermeability of cultured human lung fibroblasts after treatment\nwith Azulene. Azulene tested at 1 mM and 0.1 mM inhibited the\ngrowth of Ascites sarcoma B P8 cells by 85% and 7%, respec-\ntively.\nThe oral LD50S of Azulene in the rat and mouse were 4 g/kg\nand 3 g/kg, respectively. The intravenous LD50 in the mouse\nwas 56 mg/kg. The subcutaneous LDsos in the rat and mouse\nwere, respectively, 520 mg/kg and 145 mg/kg. The intraperi-\ntoneal LDsos were 180 mg/kg in the rat and 108 mg/kg in the\nmouse.\nWhen implanted into the brains of rats, Azulene caused non-\nspace-occupying lesions to form, but little change in brain ana-\ntomy occurred up to 140 days after treatment.In an Ames test using Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98,\nTAI00, TA1535, and TA1537, Azulene was nonmutagenic both\nwith an without metabolic activation.\nAn allergic reaction to Azulene was noted in one case report.\nPatch tests produced allergic cheilitis when 1% Azulene and a\nproduct formulation were administered.\nDISCUSSION\nIt was brought to the attention of the Cosmetic Ingredient\nReview (CIR) Expert Panel that a structurally similar compound,\nGuaiazulene, is generally known in the cosmetics industry as\nAzulene. Guaiazulene is an FDA-regulated color additive that\nis exempt from CIR review. Because Azulene has no suppliers,\nFDA frequency of use data for Azulene should be attributed to\nGuaiazulene. Other data in this review apply only to Azulene.\nFew data on Azulene were available. For example, although it\nis clear that Azulene is extracted from plant materials, sufficient\ndetail is lacking to determine if naphthalenes or other compounds\nwill be present in the extraction. Section 1, paragraph (p) of the\nCIR Procedures states that &dquo;a lack of information about an ingre-\ndient shall not be sufficient to justify a determination of safety.&dquo;\nIn accordance with Section 30(j)(2)(A) of the Procedures, the\nExpert Panel informed the public of its decision that the data\non Azulene were not sufficient for determining whether this in-\ngredient, under relevant conditions of use, was either safe or\nunsafe. The Panel released an Insufficient Data Announcement\non March 5, 1996, outlining the data needed to assess the safety\nof Azulene. No comments were received during the 90-day\npublic comment period. Additional data needed to make a safety\nassessment are: (1) methods of manufacture and impurities, es-\npecially naphthalenes; (2) concentration of use; (3) skin pene-\ntration ; if there is significant skin penetration, then both a 28-day\ndermal toxicity study to assess general skin and systemic tox-\nicity and a reproductive and developmental toxicity study are\nneeded; (4) one genotoxicity study in a mammalian system; if\npositive, then a 2-year dermal carcinogenesis study using Na-\ntional Toxicology program (NTP) methods is needed; (5) be-\ncause of UV absorption, phototoxicity and photosensitization\ndata are needed; (6) skin irritation and sensitization in animals\nor humans; and (7) ocular toxicity.\nCONCLUSION\nThe CIR Expert Panel concludes that the available data are\ninsufficient to support the safety of Azulene for use in cosmetic\nproducts.\nREFERENCES\nAdams, A.

Hill3, Curtis D. Klaassen3, Daniel Liebler3,\nJames G. Marks, Jr.3, Ronald C. Shank3, Thomas J. Slaga3,\nPaul W. Snyder3, and F. Alan Andersen4\nAbstract\nThe Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel (Panel) asses sed the safety of 244 plant-derived fatty acid oils as used\nin cosmetics. Oils are used in a wide variety of cosmetic pro ducts for their skin condition ing, occlusive, emollient,\nand moisturizing properties. Since many of these oils are e dible, and their systemic to xicity potential is low, the\nreview focused on potential dermal effects. The Panel conc luded that the 244 plant-derived fatty acid oils are safe as\nused in cosmetics.\nKeywords\noils, safety, cosmetics\nIntroduction\nOils derived from edible vegetables, fruits, seeds, tree, and\nground nuts have been safely consumed by, and applied to\nthe skin of, humans for thousands of years. Although nuts,\nfruits, and vegetables themse lves may cause allergic reac-\ntions in certain individuals, the refined oils derived from\nthese plants generally pose no significant safety concern\nfollowing oral exposure, and their general biology is well\ncharacterized due to extensiv e use in food materials. Ini-\ntially used for anointing in re ligious ceremonies, oils and\ntheir components have also been used on the skin for their\nskin conditioning, occlusive, emollient, moisturizing, and\nother properties.\nThe full list of ingredients in this report, which includes\noils, hydrogenated oils, unsapon ifiables, oil fatty acids, and\nsalts of the fatty acids, is foun di nT a b l e1 .A l t h o u g hal a r g e\nnumber of oils derived from plants are included in this\nsafety assessment, there is a c ommonality in that they all\nare mixtures of triglycerides that contain fatty acids and\nfatty acid derivatives, the saf ety of which in cosmetics has\nbeen established. Thus, thi s safety assessment focused\nsolely on the basic chemistry, manufacturing and production\nmethods, uses, and irritation and sensitization potential of\nthese oils as used in cos metic ingredients.\nIn preparing this report, num erous inconsistencies were\nnoted with both taxonomic and In ternational Nomenclature\nCosmetic Ingredient (INCI) naming conventions. For exam-\nple, this report includes the macadamia nut ingredients,Macadamia integrifolia seed oil and Macadamia ternifolia\nseed oil, which are described in the International Cosmetic\nIngredient Dictionary and Handbook .1The species Mi n t e g -\nrifolia is currently the only species of macadamia nut which is\nused for oil production. The name M ternifolia is an old\nnaming convention for the edible nut that is currently used\nto describe a noncultivated, inedible species. Both Mi n t e g r i -\nfolia seed oil and Mt e r n i f o l i a seed oil are the same ingredient.\nSimilar naming conflicts have been discovered with Triticum\nvulgare (wheat) germ oil and Triticum aestivum (wheat) germ\noil,Orbignya oleifera seed oil and Orbignya speciosa kernel\noil, and Moringa pterygosperma seed oil and Moringa olei-\nferaseed oil, with these pairs being synonyms for each other.\nThe shea plant also has 2 species names, Butyrospermum\nparkii andVitellaria paradoxa .O n l y Bp a r k i i (asB parkii\n1Cosmetic Ingredient Review Scientific Analyst/Writer, Cosmetic Ingredient\nReview, Washington, DC, USA\n2Cosmetic Ingredient Review Senior Director, Cosmetic Ingredient Review,\nWashington, DC, USA\n3Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel Member, Cosmetic Ingredient\nReview, Washington, DC, USA\n4Cosmetic Ingredient Review Former Director, Cosmetic Ingredient Review,\nWashington, DC, USA\nCorresponding Author:\nBart Heldreth, Executive Director, Cosmetic Ingredient Review, 1620 L Street,\nNW, Suite 1200, Washington, DC 20036, USA.\nEmail: cirinfo@cir-safety.orgInternational Journal of Toxicology\n2017, Vol. 36(Supplement 3) 51S-129S\nªThe Author(s) 2017\nReprints and permission:\nsagepub.com/journalsPermissions.nav\nDOI: 10.1177/1091581817740569\njournals.sagepub.com/home/ijt\nTable 1.

For\nexample, sunflower oil contains high levels of vitamins A, D,\nand K, whereas palm oil is a rich source of vitamins A and E.\nCrude sunflower oil also has the highest content of vitamin E in\nthe form of a-tocopherol among vegetable oils.3\nVegetable oil and hydrogenated vegetable oil are cosmetic\nlabeling names for blends of plant-derived oils.5The composi-\ntion of a blend is determined by the desired physical properties.\nVegetable oil and hydrogenated vegetable oil may include, but\nare not limited to, canola oil, Brassica campestris (rapeseed)\noil,Carthamus tinctorius (safflower) seed oil, Helianthus\nannuus (sunflower) seed oil, Sesamum indicum (sesame) seed\noil,Elaeis guineensis (palm) oil, E guineensis (palm kernel) oil,\nCocos nucifera (coconut) oil, Gossypium herbaceum (cotton-\nseed) oil, Glycine soja (soybean) oil, Zea mays (corn) oil, Olea\neuropaea (olive) oil, Prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond)\noil, and hydrogenated products of these oils.\nMethod of Manufacturing\nThe oil may be directly expressed from the source (seed or\npulp) followed by solvent extraction. Bailey Industrial Oil and\nFat Products states that the removal of pigments and polar\nmaterials is mandatory for most cosmetic applications.6The\nprocess used for oil refining for foods may be adequate for this\npurpose, or additional steps may be required. Special refining\nmethods to yield colorless and odorless oils are used by the\ncosmetic industry and include proprietary adsorption chroma-\ntography and supercritical fluid extractions.\nThe majority of the oils presented in this report are produced\neither from mechanical extraction or solvent extraction or a\nhybrid of both methods, known as prepress solvent extraction.3\nIn solvent extraction, hexane is the most commonly used sol-\nvent, as it is economical and easily removed from the extracted\noil. Seeds that are rich in oil can be cold pressed to extract oil\nwithout the use of solvents.7\nAfter the initial extraction by methods such as solvent\nextraction, the crude (degummed) oil is often refined.3The first\nstep is treating the oil with caustic soda to neutralize free fatty\nacids, hydrolyze phosphatides, and remove some colored pig-\nments and unsaponifiable materials. Soap stock is usually a by-\nproduct of this step. The next step involves treating the neu-\ntralized oil with activated earth to further adsorb pigments. The\nlast major step in refining oil is deodorizing, usually by a type\nof steam distillation, which is intended to remove all oxidative\ncleavage products that impart odor or flavor to the oil. Deodor-\nization also removes tocopherols, sterols, and other minor con-\nstituents of free fatty acids and undesirable foreign materials.\nFigure 2 is a flowchart of the basic refinement process.\nAfter deodorization, oils can be further processed by hydro-\ngenation, which makes oil more resistant to oxidative and ther-\nmal damage, and by winterization, where oil is slowly cooled to\npromote formation of crystals that cause cloudiness, and then\nfiltered to remove the crystals.\nCosmetic grade fatty acid plant oils may include a physical\nrefining step that involves heating crude oil under vacuum.7This step allows for the removal of volatile components such as\ncolor compounds, odor compounds, and free fatty acids, which\ngives the refined oil a lighter color, less odor, and lower acid\nvalues.\nAnalytical Methods\nNear-infrared spectroscopy and gas chromatography have been\nused, respectively, to phenotype and analyze fatty acid profiles\nin shea fat (described as V paradoxa , not B parkii ).8The fatty\nacid composition of hazel seed oil ( Corylus avellana , in crude\nform) has also been analyzed by gas chromatography.9The\ntriacylglycerol and diacylglycerol composition oils from hazel-\nnut, pistachio, almond, Brazil nut, and macadamia nuts have\nbeen characterized using high-performance liquid chromato-\ngraphy with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization and\nUV detection.10The triacylglycerol profile of Brazil nut oil\nhas also been quantified using dry matrix-assisted laser deso-\nrption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.11\nImpurities\nProteins. Many edible fatty acid oils are derived from foods that\nare recognized as potent food allergens. It has been shown that\nan individual who is allergic to a food will generally not react\nto the refined oil, especially if the oil has been “hot pressed” or\nhas undergone more processing.12,13A prime example is Ara-\nchis hypogaea (peanut) oil. Peanuts are extremely allergenic to\na large population, but reaction to the oil is rare. In its safety\nassessment on A hypogaea (peanut) oil, the Panel noted that the\nmajor concern associated with allergic reactions to peanuts is\nthe protein.14The protein does not partition into the refined oil,\nand therefore, the oil is safe for use in cosmetics. However,\nresearchers have reported protein levels in processed oils. Hal-\nsey et al reported that Lowry protein determinations of cold-\npressed and refined sunflower oil were found to be 2 to 8 mg/\nmL protein,15whereas Zitouni et al reported trace amounts of\nprotein in the refined oil.16Olszewski et al found 0.1 to 0.2 mg\nprotein per gram of peanut oil,17whereas Ramazzotti et al\nreported finding immunoglobulin E (IgE)-responsive residual\nproteins in peanut oil extracts.18Porras et al found soy protein\nin some samples of soy oil, but not others.19Awazuhara et al\nreported 1.4 to 4.0 mg protein per 100 g of soy oil.20Although\nPaschke et al found approximately 35 mg/L protein content in\nrefined soybean oil, no IgE-binding activity was detectable.21\nAlthough the Panel has found a general lack of clinical\neffects for fatty acid oils already reviewed,14,22–30other groups\nhave raised concerns. The Eu ropean Medicines Agency\n(EMEA) Working Party on Herbal Medicinal Products con-\ncluded that soy and peanut products “should be treated as aller-\ngenic unless they have an analytically monitored non-\nallergenic specification and a safe maximum daily dose.”31The\nEMEA found that threshold concentrations for induction of a\nprotein contact dermatitis were not available and recom-\nmended, “all medications for topical use containing soya or\npeanut products should be treated as allergenic.”74S International Journal of Toxicology 36(Supplement 3)Aflatoxin. Aflatoxins are metabolic products of the molds Asper-\ngillus flavus andAspergillus parasiticus . They are most often\nproduced in stored agricultural crops (such as peanuts and other\nnut crops) when growth conditions and genetic requirements\nare favorable.32–34The International Agency for Research on\nCancer (IARC) categorized aflatoxins as group 1 agents,\n“carcinogenic to humans.”35,36\nThe US government places the following limitations on pea-\nnuts to be considered “negative” for aflatoxin: /C2015 ppb for\n“peanuts which have been certified as meeting edible quality\ngrade requirements” and /C2025 ppb for “nonedible quality\ncategories” (7 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) sections\n997.30 and 998.200).37Aflatoxin contamination was not a con-\ncern in the previous CIR safety assessments of peanut oil,17\nhazelnut oil,41or coconut oil.29\nGlycidol. Glycidol and glycidol fatty acid esters have been\ndetected in refined fatty acid oils.38–41\nGossypol. Gossypol reportedly is present in refined cottonseed\noil at a concentration of /C200.01%.24The concentration ofgossypol in modified cottonseed products intended for human\nconsumption is limited by federal regulation (21CFR 112.894).\nUse\nCosmetic\nThe safety of the cosmetic ingredients addressed in this safety\nassessment is evaluated based on data received from the US\nFood and Drug Administration (FDA) and the cosmetics indus-\ntry on the expected use of these ingredients in cosmetics. Use\nfrequencies of individual ingredients in cosmetics are collected\nfrom manufacturers and reported by cosmetic product category\nin the FDA Voluntary Cosmetic Registration Program (VCRP)\ndatabase. Use concentration data are submitted by the cosmetic\nindustry in response to a survey, conducted by the Personal\nCare Products Council, of maximum reported use concentra-\ntions by product category.\nThere are 244 oil ingredients included in this safety assess-\nment, 146 of which are reported to be used; 118 of the in-use\ningredients have never been reviewed by CIR, while 28 haveCrude  Oil \nDegummed Oil Lecithin Sludge \nAlkali Refined Oil Soap Stock \nSalad Oil \nCooking Oil Salad and \nCooking Oil Partially \nHydrogenated Oil \nOther Fatty Oil \nShortening \nStockBlended Oils \nMargarine Stock Bleached Oil Salad Oil Water\nAlkali \nDeodorizationDeodorization Deodorization \nDeodorization \nDeodorization \nDeodorization Activated Earth \nH2, Catalyst \nWinterization & \nDeodorization \nFigure 2.

For the ingredients being reviewed\nfor the first time, the frequency of use42and/or concentration of\nuse43–45can be found in Table 5. (Also included in Table 5 are 3\ningredients, Citrullus vulgaris (watermelon) seed oil, macada-\nmia nut oil, and Vaccinium oxycoccos (cranberry) seed oil, that\ndo not have identifiable INCI names; these ingredients are not\npart of this assessment, but they are very similar to the oils that\nare part of this assessment, and in f o r m a t i o no nt h e mi si n c l u d e di n\nthis report for completeness.) For the ingredients that have been\nreviewed previously, the current and historical23–26,28,46–48fre-\nquency and concentration of use is given in Table 6. The 97 ingre-\ndients not currently reported t o be used are listed in Table 7.42–45,49,50\nOf the oils included in this report, Bp a r k i i (shea) butter has\nthe most reported uses in cosmetic and personal care products,\nwith a total of 1,950; 1,680 of those uses are in leave-on\nformulations. A recent survey of use concentrations for B\nparkii (shea) butter reports a max imum use concentration of\n60%in leave-on products as a cu ticle softener, a manicuring\napplication.51Helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil has the\nsecond greatest number of overall uses reported, with a total\nof 1,414; 1,054 of those uses are in leave-on formulations,\nhaving use concentrations up to 96 %. Many other ingredients\nare used in an extensive number of formulations. For exam-\nple, prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil, O europaea\n(olive) fruit oil, and Gs o j a (soybean) oil have 1,127, 915, and\n912 uses, respectively. Most o f the in-use ingredients have\nuses in both leave-on and rinse-off product types, many are\nused in products that are applied around the eye and some are\nused in a way they can possibly be ingested. Some are used in\nproducts that involve mucous membrane exposure, and a few\nare used in underarm deodorant formulations. Many of the\nproducts are used in formulati ons at relatively high concen-\ntrations. Olea europaea ( o l i v e )f r u i to i li su s e da tu pt o1 0 0 %,\nPersea gratissima (avocado) oil is used at up to 98 %,H\nannuus ( s u n f l o w e r )s e e do i la tu pt o9 6 %,a n d Gs o j a (soy-\nbean) oil at 95 %.\nOils are used in a wide variety of cosmetic products for their\nskin conditioning, occlusive, emollient, moisturizing, and other\nproperties. Some of the oils included in this report are used in\nproducts that can be inhaled, and effects on the lungs that may\nbe induced by aerosolized products containing these ingredi-\nents are of concern. The particle size of aerosol hair sprays and\nof pump hair sprays is 38 and >80 mm, respectively, and is\nrelatively large compared to respirable particle sizes ( /C2010\nmm). Therefore, because of their size, most aerosol particles\nare deposited in the nasopharyngeal region and are not\nrespirable.\nNone of the oils, hydrogenate d oils, unsaponifiables, oil\nfatty acids, and salts of the fatty acids described in this report\nwere restricted from use in any way under the rules governing\ncosmetic products in the European Union.52\nNoncosmetic\nThe primary use of plant-derived fatty acid oils is for cooking.\nPalm oil is the world’s most widely consumed edible oil (41.7million metric tons), followed by soybean oil, rapeseed oil,\nsunflower seed oil, cottonseed oil, peanut oil, palm kernel oil,\ncoconut oil, and olive oil.3,53Nonfood, noncosmetic uses for\nedible fatty acid oils are found in Table 8.\nToxicological Studies\nMany of the fatty acid oils in this assessment are edible, and\nexposure to the oils from food use would result in a much larger\nsystemic dose than that resulting from use in cosmetic prod-\nucts. Consequently, their systemic toxicity potential, except as\ndiscussed below relating to carcinogenicity, is not addressed in\nthis report. The safety focus of use of these oils as cosmetic\ningredients is the potential for irritation and sensitization.\nCarcinogenicity\nThe safety of glycidol fatty acid esters in refined vegetable oils\nwas assessed by IARC. Glycidol was determined to be a group\n2A (probably carcinogenic to humans) chemical, while glyci-\nd o lf a t t ya c i de s t e r sw e r ed e t e r m i n e dt ob eag r o u p3( n o t\nclassifiable as to carcinogenicity to humans) chemical.40,41\nThe Federal Institute for Risk Assessment in Germany\nreleased a summary of their initial evaluation of the assessment\nof levels of glycidol fatty acid esters detected in refined vege-\ntable fats.39Although acknowledging that the levels of glycidol\nthat may be released from glycidol fatty acid esters are not\nknown, the evaluation noted that glycidol is classified as prob-\nably carcinogenic to humans. The evaluation was based on\nfindings of the German Chemical and Veterinary Test Agency\nthat noted that glycidol is converted to 3-chloropropanediol and\nit appeared to be the 3-chloropropanediol that was detected in\nthe vegetable fat.38The levels of 3-chloropropanediol were\nnegligible at the crude oil, degummed, neutralized, and\nbleached stages, but levels were significant at the deodorized\nstage.\nAnacardium occidentale (Cashew) Seed Oil\nThe modulatory effect of A occidentale (cashew) seed oil on\nantioxidant potential was investigated in female Swiss albino\nmice in a 120-day skin papillomagenesis study.54The mice\nwere divided into 4 groups of 15 and 1 group of 10 (vehicle\ncontrol). Test groups were as follows: group I was the vehicle\ncontrol, receiving 0.1 mL acetone; group II was the positive\ncontrol, receiving a single dose of 7,12-dimethylbenz( a)anthra-\ncene (DMBA; 0.005 mg/0.05 mL acetone) followed by appli-\ncations of 2 %croton oil 3 times a week until study termination;\ngroup III received a single dose of DMBA followed by appli-\ncations of 2.5 %cashew nut kernel oil 3 times a week until\nstudy termination; group IV received a single dose of DMBA\nfollowed by applications of 5 %cashew nut kernel oil 3 times a\nweek until study termination; and group V received 5 %cashew\nnut kernel oil applied until study termination. The oil was\napplied to the clipped dorsal scapular region that was 2 cm in\ndiameter. Body weights were recorded at regular intervals.76S International Journal of Toxicology 36(Supplement 3)Table 5.

Elaeis guineensis (palm) oil, 5%,\nwas nonallergenic in a maximization study23\nGossypium herbaceum (cotton) seed oil\nCosmetic formulations containing 3.4% to 8.97% hydrogenated cottonseed oil were not irritating to rabbit skin24\nOryza sativa (rice) bran oil\nUndiluted Oryza sativa (rice) bran oil was not irritating to rabbits, and in a guinea pig maximization study, no reactions were observed\nwhen 5% was used at induction and 25% and 50% Oryza sativa (rice) bran oil were used at challenge. An Oryza sativa (rice) bran oil/\nOryza sativa (rice) germ oil mixture, concentrations not stated, did not cause a contact allergy response. Undiluted hydrolyzed rice\nprotein was also not irritating or sensitizing25\nOryza sativa (rice) germ oil\nOryza sativa (rice) germ oil was not a primary dermal irritant25\nPrunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil\nUndiluted prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil and 2 moisturizer formulations, each containing 25% prunus amygdalus dulcis\n(sweet almond) oil, were tested for skin irritancy in rabbits using occlusive patches. Undiluted prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet\nalmond) oil was nonirritating (primary irritation index, PII ¼0/4). The formulations containing 25% prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet\nalmond) oil were minimally irritating (PIIs ¼0.28 and 0.72, respectively).\nIn a 60-day cumulative irritation test, 10% and 100% prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil was applied to rabbits. When tested\nin 7 separate trials, 100% prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil produced mean maximum irritation indices (MMIIs) ranging\nfrom 0.34 to 1.34 (maximum score ¼8). At a concentration of 10%, MMIIs for this ingredient ranged from 0 to 0.66. Results\nindicated that, when applied to the skin over a long period of time, prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil is slightly irritating;\nwhereas at 10%, it is practically nonirritating\nA maximization assay was used to determine the sensitizing potential of prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil using guinea\npigs. Intradermal induction used concentrations of 5% amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil, the dose-range phase of the\nexperiment used a single dermal application of 5%, 10%, or 100% Prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil, a booster induction\ninjection of 100% Prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil was applied occlusively for 48 hours 1 week later, challenge was\nwith 5% prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil in petrolatum applied topically under occlusion for 24 hours. Prunus amygdalus\ndulcis (sweet almond) oil was nonsensitizing\nUndiluted prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil was tested for irritancy in groups of 6 male albino rabbits. The test material\nwas applied under occlusion to the clipped intact and abraded dorsal skin of each animal. Twenty-three hours later, patches were\nremoved; sites were scored at 24 and 48 hours. The primary irritation indices (PIIs) for 7 test samples of prunus amygdalus dulcis\n(sweet almond) oil ranged from 0 to 0.18 (maximum score ¼8), indicating that this ingredient is practically nonirritating to skin208\n(continued)Burnett et al 95Sguinea pig skin, and 5 %aqueous solutions of a bar soap con-\ntaining 13 %sodium cocoate had irritation scores of 1.6 to 4.0\nof 8 in animal studies. However, the majority of the remaining\nanimal irritation and/or sensitization studies conducted on a\nlarge number of the oils included in this report, primarily in\nformulation, did not report any significant irritation or sensiti-\nzation reactions, indicating that refined oils derived from plants\nare not dermal irritants or sensitizers. None of the tested oils,\nincluding B parkii (shea) butter (up to 20 %) and Oryza sativa\n(rice) germ oil ( /C2075%), were phototoxic in animal studies. The\ncomedogenicity of C avellana (hazel) seed oil was evaluated\nusing rabbits, and a slight difference in the number and size of\nthe pilosebaceous follicles and a slight excess of sebum and a\ndilation of the follicles were observed.\nHuman\nPlant-derived fatty acid oils are commonly believed to be safe\nfor use on the skin.6de Groot notes that no documentation\nexists to show that high-quality edible lipids cause adverse\nreactions in normal individuals (except for potential comedo-\ngenicity).55Very few reports of adverse reactions to cosmetic\nuse of edible fatty acid oils have been reported.\nMany plant-derived fatty acid oils are derived from foods\nthat are recognized as potent food allergens. The allergic reac-\ntions are thought to be caused by the proteins present in the\nfood. It has been shown that an individual who is allergic to a\nfood will generally not react to the refined oil, especially if theoil has been “hot pressed” or has undergone more process-\ning.12,13In its safety assessment on A hypogaea (peanut) oil,\nthe Panel noted that while peanuts are extremely allergenic to a\nlarge population, reaction to the oil is rare. The major concern\nassociated with allergic reactions to peanuts is the protein,14\nwhich does not partition into the refined oil; therefore, the oil is\nsafe for use in cosmetics. Crevel et al also concluded that\nchemically refined peanut oil is safe for the majority of peanut\nallergic individuals.13They stated that “as peanut is acknowl-\nedged to be one of the most potent food allergens, it is reason-\nable to extrapolate the conclusions drawn up for peanut oil to\nother edible oils.” However, they concede that validated ana-\nlytical methodology for establishing the protein content of oil is\nneeded.\nIn support of the conclusions stated earlier, Crevel et al also\nexamined the allergenicity of some other oils. Very few\ninstances of allergic reactions to other major edible fatty acid\noils have been reported. Even sesame oil, which differs from\nthe other oils, is used as a flavorant and, therefore, is not\nrefined, is expected to contain significantly more protein than\nthe other edible fatty acid oils, and has had very few reports of\nallergic reaction. Additional studies demonstrating safety are\nsummarized later in this section.15,56\nA large number of clinical irritation and sensitization studies\nwere made available on many of the oils, primarily in formula-\ntion, and these studies are summarized in Table 11. All of the\ndata indicated that the oils were not irritants or sensitizers.\nSummary statements of human dermal studies, includingTable 10.

Although\nthe majority of the oils were nonirritating to mildly irritating, a few\nstudies indicated some significant irritation. For example, a lotion\ncontaining 1.5 %E guineensis (palm) oil was moderately irritating\nto rabbit eyes, and a mascara containing 9.4 %Linum usitatissimum\n(linseed) seed oil was predicted to be moderately irritating in an\nalternative assay. Available ocu lar irritation studies are summar-\nized in Table 13. Summary statements of ocular irritation studies\nfrom previous CIR reports on oils are provided in Table 14.\nHuman\nIn clinical ocular irritation studies, formulations containing\n9.4%L usitatissimum (linseed) oil and 0.2 %Ribes nigrum\n(blackcurrant) seed oil did not produce adverse reactions and\nwere considered safe for contact lens wearers. These studies are\nalso summarized in Table 13.\nClinical Studies\nClinical Trials/Case Studies\nPlant-derived fatty acid oils have been used as vehicles for\ndelivery of therapeutic agents or used alone in treating skin\ndisorders. Adverse reactions to the oils were notably absentin such clinical tests. Case studies have reported isolated aller-\ngic reactions. The available data are summarized in Table 15.\nSummary\nThe report addresses the safety of plant-derived fatty acid oils.\nThese oils, which are derived from vegetable and fruit plants,\nare composed of monoglycerides, diglycerides, and primarily\ntriglycerides, free fatty acids, and other minor components,\nincluding natural antioxidants and fat-soluble vitamins. The\npercentage of chemical constituents and nutritional content of\nindividual oil types is dependent on region where the oil plant\nis grown, individual cultivars, and plant genetics. Oils used in\ncosmetics are likely produced in the same manner as those used\nin the food industry. Oils may be expressed through mechanical\nor solvent extraction. The oils may undergo further refining,\nsuch as neutralizing, bleaching, and deodorizing, to remove pig-\nments, odors, unsaponifiable materials, and other undesirables.\nSo that all plant-derived fatty acid oils that are cosmetic\ningredients are included in 1 report, several ingredients that\nhave been reviewed previously by the Panel are included in\nthis report. The ingredients, their conclusions, and citations are\nfound in Table 2. Some study results utilized in those previous\nsafety assessments were also utilized in this safety assessment\nand cited below where appropriate.\nIndividuals who have food allergies to a plant protein rarely\nexhibit allergic reactions when exposed to refined oils of the\nsame plant. Data evaluation by the Panel regarding the method\nof manufacture indicates that protein constituents do not parti-\ntion into the refined oils. The Panel has also found a general lack\nof clinical effects for fatty acid oils that they have already\nreviewed; however, other researchers have raised concerns about\nthe presence of residual proteins in oils, such as peanut and soy.Table 11.

Cosmetic formulations\ncontaining 10.6% to 20.86% hydrogenated cottonseed oil were not irritating or sensitizing.24\nOryza sativa (rice) bran oil\nRice is generally regarded as hypoallergenic, although some case studies of allergic reactions to raw rice have been reported. In\nclinical testing, formulations containing 1.04% to 8.0% Oryza sativa (rice) bran oil were not irritating or sensitizing. Hydrolyzed rice\nprotein was not irritating to human participants.25\nPersea gratissima (avocado) oil\nPersea gratissima (avocado) oil was not an irritant or sensitizer when human participants were patch tested with cosmetic\nformulations containing up to 10.7% Persea gratissima (avocado) oil or in patch tests using 100% Persea gratissima (avocado) oil.27\nPrunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil\nUndiluted Prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil was nonirritating in a single insult patch test with 101 participants, and it was\nnonirritating and nonsensitizing in an HRIPT using 52 participants. Cosmetic formulations containing 0.1% to -5% were practically\nnonirritating and nonsensitizing in HRIPTs performed with 6,906 participants.

The safety focus of use\nof these oils as cosmetic ingredients is on the potential for\nirritation and sensitization. Undiluted, technical grade, A hypo-\ngaea (peanut) oil was moderately irritating to rabbits and gui-\nnea pig skin, and 5 %aqueous solutions of a bar soap containing\n13%sodium cocoate had irritation scores of 1.6 to 4.0 of 8 in\nanimal studies. However, the majority of the remaining animal\nirritation and/or sensitization studies conducted on a large num-\nber of the oils included in this report, primarily in formulation,\ndid not report any significant irritation or sensitizationreactions, indicating that refined oils derived from plants are\nnot dermal irritants or sensiti zers. None of the tested oils,\nincluding B parkii (shea) butter (up to 20 %) and O sativa (rice)\ngerm oil ( /C2075%), were phototoxic in animal studies. The\ncomedogenicity of C avellana (hazel) seed oil was evaluated\nusing rabbits, and a slight difference in the number and size of\nthe pilosebaceous follicles and a slight excess of sebum and a\ndilation of the follicles were observed.\nThe results of a large number of clinical irritation, sensitiza-\ntion, and photoxicity/photosensitziation studies indicated that\nplant-derived fatt acid oils were not irritants or sensitizers in\nhumans. In clinical testing with an eye mask containing 0.2 %\nRibes nigrum (blackcurrant) seed oil (undiluted), the formula-\ntion was noncomedogenic.Table 14.

An eye mask containing 0.2 %R nigrum (black-\ncurrant) seed oil (undiluted) was tested and considered safe for\ncontact lens wearers.\nPlant-derived fatty acid oils have been used as vehicles for\ndelivery of therapeutic agents or used alone in treating skin\ndisorders. Adverse reactions to the oils were notably absentin such clinical tests. Case studies have reported isolated aller-\ngic reactions.\nDiscussion\nPlant-derived fatty acid oils, oils which have been hydroge-\nnated to reduce or eliminate unsaturation, fatty acid salts, and\noil unsaponifiables were reviewed by the Panel. Most of these\ningredients in this report are mixtures of triglycerides contain-\ning fatty acids and fatty acid derivatives, the safety of which in\ncosmetics has been established. Upon review of these ingredi-\nents, the Panel expressed concern regarding gossypol (for\ncotton-derived ingredients), pesticide residues, and heavy\nmetals that may be present in botanical ingredients. The Panel\nstressed that the cosmetics industry should continue to use theTable 15. (continued)\nIngredient Patients/condition Effect/observation Reference\nOlea europaea (olive) fruit oil\nOlea europaea (olive) fruit oil Throughout the literature, it is stated that sensitization to\nOlea europaea (olive) fruit oil is considered rare. Case\nreports have been described, however, and generally\ninvolved patients with venous eczema, some type of\ndermatitis or lesion, or an occupational exposure. Patch\ntesting with Olea europaea (olive) fruit oil produced positive\nreactions in most of these cases, and these results were\nusually regarded as allergenic. The concentrations of Olea\neuropaea (olive) fruit oil tested were not always given, but,\nwhen stated, test concentrations giving positive results,\nranged from 30% to100%. When the constituents of olive oil\nwere tested as well, the results of that testing were negative.318–325\nOlea europaea (olive) fruit oil Whether the reactions to olive oil were contact\nsensitization or irritation were investigated using open and\nocclusive testing. It was concluded that olive oil presented as\na weak irritant rather than a contact sensitizer in the few\ncase studies was observed.326\nPersea gratissima (avocado) oil\nPersea gratissima (avocado)\noil1 female; dermatitis around the\neyes and earlobesPatch testing with her sunscreen resulted in positive results. In\nsubsequent patch testing of the ind ividual ingredients, a positive\nreaction to undiluted oil, but not to the active ingredient, was\nobserved; 20 control participants were involved, and reactions\ntoPersea gratissima (avocado) oil were not seen.327\nSesamum indicum (sesame) seed oil\nSesamum indicum (sesame)\nseed oil in an ointmentFemale Pruritic erythema, papules, and vesicles appeared after\napplication of the ointment; patch testing was performed\nwith the ointment and with the individual ingredients,\nincluding undiluted Sesamum indicum (sesame) seed oil.\nBoth the ointment and Sesamum indicum (sesame) seed oil\nproduced positive reactions on days 2, 3, 4, and 1; the other\ncomponents did not cause a reaction.\nResults were negative in patch testing of Sesamum indicum\n(sesame) seed oil using 20 healthy participants.328\nAbbreviations: IgE, immunoglubulin E; IgG4, immunoglobulin G4.114S International Journal of Toxicology 36(Supplement 3)necessary procedures to limit these impurities in the ingredient\nbefore blending into cosmetic formulations.\nAdditionally, the Panel considered the safety of glycidol\nand glycidol fatty acid esters in refined vegetable oils.\nAlthough the Panel recognizes that these impurities may be\ncarcinogenic, absorption through the skin would be very low\nand likely does not pose a significant hazard. Nonetheless,\nsuppliers should take steps to eliminate or reduce the presence\nof glycidol and glycidol fatty acid esters in plant-based fatty\nacid oils that are used in cosmeti c products. Aflatoxins, which\nare potent carcinogens, may be present in moldy nuts and\ncoconut copra but are not found i no i l se x p r e s s e df r o mt h e s e\nnuts and copra. The Panel adopted the US Department of\nAgriculture designation of /C2015 ppb as corresponding to\n“negative” aflatoxin content.\nCertain plant-derived oils are used in cosmetic products that\nmay be inhaled during their use. In practice, however, the par-\nticle sizes produced by the cosmetic aerosols are not respirable.\nThe Panel discussed the relationship between food allergies\nand exposure to refined oils. Individuals who have food aller-\ngies to a plant protein rarely exhibit allergic reactions when\nexposed to refined oils of the same plant. The Panel has found a\ngeneral lack of clinical effects for plant-derived fatty acid oils\nalready reviewed.\nFatty acid composition data were available for the majority\nof the oils included in this review and the Panel agreed that the\ncomposition data, in combination with the available data on\nmethod of manufacture, impur ities, safety test data, a long\nhistory of safe use in foods, and an absence of adverse reactions\nin clinical experience, were a sufficient basis for determining\nsafety. The Panel did note that vegetable oil is a blend of a\nnumber of different oils and that a specific composition of\nvegetable oil was not available. The Panel determined that the\nsafety of vegetable oil as used in cosmetic formulations has\nbeen established, providing t hat the blend contains oils for\nwhich the fatty acid composition is known.\nAdditionally, although data on th e fatty acid composition of\nFragaria vesca (strawberry) seed oil and Fragaria virginiana\n(strawberry) seed oil were not available, data were available for\nFragaria ananassa (strawberry) seed oil and Fragaria chiloensis\n(strawberry) seed oil. In that the fatty acid compositions of F ana-\nnassa andF chiloensis (strawberry) seed oil were similar to each\nother and it was assumed that Fv e s c a andF virginiana (strawberry)\nseed oils would also have similar fatty acid compositions.\nThe Panel also noted that arachidonic acid is a fatty acid\nconstituent of Lycium barbarum seed oil, O sativa (rice) germ\noil, and Sclerocarya birrea seed oil. Although a previously\npublished CIR evaluation concluded that insufficient data exist\nto support the safety of arachidonic acid in cosmetic products,\nthe Panel was of the opinion that the concentration of use of\nthese ingredients was sufficiently low that the amount of free\narachidonic acid from these oils would not warrant concern.\nFinally, the conclusion reached by the Panel on the safety of\nthe plant-derived fatty acid oils supersedes the 2001 conclusion\nof insufficient data for Corylus americana and C avellana\n(hazel) seed oil.Conclusion\nThe Panel concluded that the 244 plant-derived fatty acid oils\nincluded in this review are safe in the present practices of use\nand concentration described in this safety assessment. Were\ningredients not in current use (as indicated by *) to be used\nin the future, the expectation is that they would be used in\nproduct categories and concentrations comparable to others\nin this group.

Upon re-review in November 2002, thePanel reaf ﬁrmed the original conclusion, as published in 2005.\n2\nPrunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil was not con-\nsidered in this re-review because it was included in the safetyassessment of plant-derived fatty acids, published in 2017.\n3\nBecause it has been at least 15 years since the prior re-review\nwas published, in accordance w ith Cosmetic Ingredient Review\n(CIR) Procedures, the Panel cons idered whether the safety as-\nsessment should be reopened. At its March 2023 meeting, thePanel considered updated (2022) information regarding producttypes and ingredient use frequen cies as reported in the US Food\nand Drug Administration (FDA) Voluntary Cosmetic Registra-\ntion Program (VCRP) database\n4and maximum use concentra-\ntions provided in response to the survey conducted by thePersonal Care Products Council.\n5Since the initial re-review was\nconsidered, the frequency of use for Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis\n(Sweet Almond) Seed Meal has decreased slightly from 15 to 14uses.\n4In 2002, the maximum concentration of use for this in-\ngredient was reported to be 27% in leave-on products and 2% inrinse-off products.\n2No concentrations of use were reported in the\n2022 survey for this ingredient.5The cumulative frequency and\nconcentration of use data are presented in Table 1 .In January 2023, an extensive search of the world ’s lit-\nerature was performed for studies dated 1997 forward. No newtoxicological data were found.\nIn summary, the Panel reviewed 2022 frequency and\nconcentration of use data and noted the lack of any new,available, relevant safety data. Considering this information,\nas well as the information provided in the original safety\nassessment and the prior re-review document, the Panel re-afﬁrmed the 1983 conclusion. The Panel discussed the pos-\nsibility for this ingredient to be used in cosmetic productswhich may be incidentally inhaled.
